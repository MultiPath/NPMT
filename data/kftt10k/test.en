dogen was a zen monk in the early kamakura period .
the founder of soto zen
later in his life he also went by the name k@@ igen .
within the sect he is referred to by the honorary title kos@@ o .
posthumously named bus@@ sho den@@ to kokushi , or jo@@ yo-@@ daishi .
he is generally called dogen zenji .
he is re@@ pu@@ ted to have been the one that spread the practices of to@@ oth bru@@ shing , face wa@@ shing , table manners and clean@@ ing in japan .
another story has it that he was the first one to bring mos@@ o-@@ chi@@ ku -lrb- mos@@ o bamboo -rrb- to japan .
though some points are unclear about dogen ` s birth , all accoun@@ ts ag@@ ree that he was born in the line of udaijin -lrb- minister of the right -rrb- michi@@ chika tsuchimikado -lrb- minamoto no michi@@ chika or michi@@ chika koga -rrb- .
although it is generally accepted that he was born in sh@@ oden san@@ so in ko@@ hata , kyoto , to michi@@ chika and fujiwara no ishi , the daughter of daijo-daijin -lrb- grand minister of state -rrb- moto@@ fusa matsu@@ dono -lrb- fujiwara no moto@@ fusa -rrb- , recent research suggests that he may have been the son of michi@@ tomo horikawa , who was presumed to be his adop@@ tive father .
another account says his father was the son of michi@@ chika , minamoto no m@@ ichim@@ une or michi@@ teru koga .
according to the biography `` ken@@ z@@ ei@@ ki `` , he lost his father -lrb- michi@@ chika -rrb- at 3 years of age , his mother at 8 , and was adopted by his half brother michi@@ tomo horikawa .
yet another account tells that his maternal uncle moro@@ ie matsu@@ dono -lrb- former regent and interior minister -rrb- wanted to adopt him as an heir after his parents died , but dogen , feeling the un@@ cer@@ tain@@ ty of the world , declined .
there is a story that he was acquain@@ ted with shinran , the founder of shin buddhism , as they were related via their mo@@ thers ; but there is no pro@@ of .
some have said that the `` life and death `` section of his `` sho@@ bog@@ en@@ zo `` was written for shinran .
ken@@ ry@@ aku 3 -lrb- 12@@ 13 -rrb- - visited his maternal uncle ryok@@ en at mt . hiei .
12@@ 14 - entered the priesthood under koen , the head of tendai buddhism , and took the name bu@@ p@@ po@@ bo dogen .
12@@ 15 - pursu@@ ed tendai religious studies under ko@@ in at onjo-ji temple .
12@@ 17 - studied under myo@@ zen , a disciple of e@@ isai , at ken@@ nin@@ -ji temple .
12@@ 23 - left from hakata with myo@@ zen to southern song china and visited jo@@ zan , where he received a certific@@ ate of dharma trans@@ mission from soto zen ` s t@@ endo nyo@@ zo .
12@@ 28 - returned to japan .
12@@ 33 - opened ko@@ sho-ji temple at fukakusa , kyoto .
around this time he came under pressure from mt . hiei .
july , 12@@ 43 - moved to echizen shi@@ hi@@ -no-@@ sho at the inv@@ itation of yoshishige hat@@ ano , lord of echizen province .
on the way , he stopped in kutsuki at the inv@@ itation of the village chief , nobu@@ tsuna sasaki -lrb- this is the origin of ko@@ sho-ji temple in takashima city -rrb- .
12@@ 44 - opened dai@@ butsu@@ -ji temple in kas@@ amatsu .
12@@ 46 - changed the name of dai@@ butsu@@ -ji to ei@@ hei@@ -ji temple , and his own name to k@@ igen .
around this time he went to kamakura to te@@ ach , at the inv@@ itation of regent tokiyori hojo and yoshishige hat@@ ano .
although he only spent half of a year in kamakura , it was the beginning of a gen@@ u@@ ine flour@@ ishing of zen in the kanto region .
12@@ 53 - after falling ill and turning over ei@@ hei@@ -ji to his disciple k@@ oun e@@ jo , he died at the house -lrb- tak@@ atsu@@ ji-@@ dori nishin@@ oto@@ in-@@ dori , kyoto -rrb- of a lay disciple , kak@@ un@@ en , at age 54 .
cause of death was a bo@@ il .
he emphasized that budd@@ ha@@ hood is not something that is completed once one has attained a certain level ; rather , continu@@ ing to see@@ k further budd@@ ha@@ hood through end@@ less training , even after one has become a buddha , is the es@@ sence of budd@@ ha@@ hood -lrb- shu@@ sho ichin@@ yo -rrb- ; and the highest form of training is to be like the sak@@ yamuni and simply do sitting meditation -lrb- shi@@ kan t@@ aza -rrb- .
most of kamakura buddhism af@@ fir@@ med the no@@ tion of the dec@@ ad@@ ent age , but in his sho@@ bog@@ en@@ zo zu@@ im@@ on@@ ki he wrote `` i tell you now , this is completely false .
the idea of the decline of true budd@@ ha@@ -@@ dharma is only a temporary means for teaching .
the true teaching is different .
by training according to the teaching , any@@ body can achieve enlightenment .
the monks at the time of the sak@@ yamuni were not all outstanding people .
there were those who had rare and inc@@ redi@@ ble evil in their hear@@ ts , and there were fo@@ ols .
the many rules that the say@@ kam@@ uni made were for the bad and fo@@ ol@@ ish people .
people are all owners of the quality to be able to become buddha .
don ` t think that you are not qual@@ ified . if you train according to the teaching , you will sure@@ ly att@@ ain enlightenment . `` he thus noted that the disciples at the time of sak@@ yamuni were not all outstanding people , den@@ ying the dec@@ ad@@ ent age by saying that it is nothing more than a sk@@ ill@@ ful means .

the ume@@ koji steam locomotive museum is a preservation and display facility for steam locomot@@ ives , operated by west japan railway company -lrb- jr west japan -rrb- , located in kan@@ ki@@ ji-cho , shimo@@ g@@ yo-@@ ku , kyoto city , kyoto prefecture .
on october 10 , 1972 , the japan national railway opened a sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ c@@ ular gar@@ age at the ume@@ koji eng@@ ine y@@ ard in shimo@@ gy@@ ou@@ -@@ ku , kyoto in celebration of the 100@@ th anniversary of the first railway in japan . the first of its kind , this facility preser@@ ves working steam locomot@@ ives , honor@@ ing them as preci@@ ous art@@ if@@ acts of industrial culture that supported the japanese rai@@ l transport system .
jr west japan took over the facility in 1987 , following the bre@@ aku@@ p and privat@@ ization of japanese national railways .
the facility itself is also an active depot -lrb- ume@@ koji rail@@ y@@ ard -rrb- , and car@@ ries out insp@@ ections and maintenance on steam locomot@@ ives and japanese national railways dies@@ el locomotive class de@@ 10 owned by sagano scenic railway .
initially , this facility was established for working preservation of steam locomot@@ ives , which had begun dis@@ appearing rapidly in the latter half of the 196@@ 0s .
the ko@@ yama eng@@ ine y@@ ard at ko@@ yama station in tochigi prefecture was the best candid@@ ate for the locomotive preservation area because it was close to the capital , but the ume@@ koji eng@@ ine y@@ ard was chosen in 1970 for its central location in japan and the presence of other historic spots in the area .
re@@ views had been made to sel@@ ect , in principle , low@@ est@@ -@@ numbered ex@@ tant steam locomot@@ ives -lrb- # 1 if possible -rrb- for preservation , but there are some steam locomot@@ ives , such as the class c@@ 62 # 2 , that were not originally planned for preservation .
the facilities con@@ s@@ ist of the steam locomotive display hall , taking advantage of the sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ c@@ ular gar@@ age and tur@@ n@@ table of the former ume@@ koji eng@@ ine depot , and the educational display g@@ all@@ ery at the former nijo station building which was moved and rebuilt at this location .
the sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ c@@ ular gar@@ age of rein@@ forced concrete construction -lrb- built in 1914 -rrb- was designated as an important cultural property by the japanese government on december 10 , 2004 , along with its 5-@@ ton electric ceiling cran@@ e -lrb- completed in 1915 -rrb- and access rai@@ ls .
in 2004 , it was also chosen by the japan society of civil engine@@ ers as a public works heritage site .
in 2006 , the former nijo station building -lrb- g@@ all@@ ery -rrb- and the sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ c@@ ular gar@@ age , along with the preserved steam locomot@@ ives as well as inspection and maintenance equipment , etc. were designated as railway memorial objects and railway semi-@@ memorial objects by jr west japan .
the former nijo station building , built in 1904 by the kyoto railway company to double as a headquarters building , is now the oldest 2-@@ story , wooden , japanese-style station building , and was modeled after heian jingu shrine with har@@ mon@@ y with the surrounding landscape in mind .
it was used as a station building by japanese national railways and jr west japan after kyoto railway company was nation@@ alized in 1907 ; but its use as a station building ended in 1996 , following the elev@@ ation of the sanin line -lrb- sagano line -rrb- between nijo and hanazono stations -lrb- in kyoto prefecture -rrb- , and in 1997 was rebuilt on this site to be used as an entrance , with its original in@@ door facilities such as ticket win@@ dow@@ s being used as a g@@ all@@ ery .
it was designated a cultural property of the city of kyoto in april 1996 .
the sem@@ ic@@ ir@@ c@@ ular gar@@ age houses and dis@@ plays 18 steam locomot@@ ives -lrb- originally 17 when the facility first opened -rrb- of 16 different classes - all manufactured in japan from the taisho to showa periods .
when this museum opened , there was a rule that locomot@@ ives should be preserved in working conditions . in fact , 15 locomot@@ ives excluding the two -lrb- class c@@ 53 # 45 and class c@@ 51 # 2@@ 39 -rrb- were registered for operation . however , the s@@ cop@@ e of locomot@@ ives to be preserved has been re@@ considered several times since then . as of 2006 , 7 locomot@@ ives of 7 different classes are preserved in working conditions .
of those , 5 steam locomot@@ ives of 5 different classes are still registered for operation , and 2 -lrb- class c@@ 57 # 1 and class c@@ 56 # 16@@ 0 -rrb- are in service to pul@@ l trains on main lines such as the yamaguchi on the yamaguchi line and the kita biwako on the hokuriku main line .
the others in working conditions are registered but can not run on the main lines because they have not under@@ gone general insp@@ ections .
also , the s@@ l ste@@ am@@ lin@@ er - pulled by a locomotive being preserved in working conditions for display in the museum - is running on the tracks of the museum site .
this display track once stret@@ ched north from the gar@@ age to the northern edge of the grounds , where there is now a parking lot for large vehi@@ cles -lrb- where a rest facility for the museum and a park were once located -rrb- . in line with re@@ location of the former nijo station building , it was re@@ arranged to go through the southern edge of ume@@ koji park and under the sagano line tracks .
today this is still a func@@ tional eng@@ ine depot , and is connected to rai@@ l lines in operation .
after the closing of west japan railway company ` s takat@@ ori plant , the facility has also taken over maintenance of steam locomot@@ ives .
ume
stands for ume@@ koji
all the steam locomot@@ ives , except for class c@@ 62 # 1 that was designated in 1976 , were designated as railway semi-@@ memorial objects together with its log@@ s and maintenance tools in 2006 .
unless o@@ ther@@ wise noted , the steam locomot@@ ives were transferred from the previous eng@@ ine de@@ po@@ ts in 1972 .
regist@@ ra@@ ion of steam locomot@@ ives marked with * had been del@@ et@@ ed when they were brought to ume@@ koji for preservation .

shom@@ yo is one of the traditional forms of japanese music .
it is a chan@@ t of buddhist scriptures and a religious music for ceremonies .
it is also called bon@@ bai and bon@@ n@@ oku in japanese .
it is written as 聲@@ 明 in the old form .
shom@@ yo is the name for one of the academic fields -lrb- gom@@ yo -rrb- of ancient india .
gom@@ yo refers to five academic fields - shom@@ yo -lrb- phon@@ ology and gr@@ am@@ ma@@ r -rrb- , kug@@ yom@@ yo -lrb- techn@@ ics and technology -rrb- , i@@ homyo -lrb- medical science -rrb- , in@@ myo -lrb- eth@@ ics -rrb- and nai@@ myo -lrb- study of a scholar ` s religion , as in buddhism for a buddhist -rrb- .
it was introduced to japan together with buddhism and became well established .
there is a record that a buddhist ceremony invol@@ ving the use of shom@@ yo was held at the opening ceremony for the todai-ji temple great buddha eye in 7@@ 54 , so it is believed that shom@@ yo flourished during the nara period .
during the early heian period , saicho and kukai introduced shom@@ yo and founded tendai shom@@ yo and shingon shom@@ yo , respectively .
buddhist sects other than the ten@@ dai-@@ shu and shing@@ on-@@ shu sects also have their own shom@@ yo , each of which has been handed down to the present day .
because shom@@ yo was passed down by kud@@ en -lrb- hand@@ ing down from month to ear -rrb- , there was no musical no@@ tation .
therefore , its initi@@ ation was extremely difficult .
later , hakase was invented as an equivalent of musical no@@ tation .
there are differences in technical terms -lrb- such as hakase -rrb- in each school .
however , hakase was a reference to chan@@ t , and in order to learn shom@@ yo , kud@@ en -lrb- also called ro@@ i , or direct initi@@ ation by an instructor -rrb- was necessary ; therefore , conserv@@ ation and inheritance were impossible from the per@@ spective of a master to a disciple .
therefore , the development of instruc@@ tors and success@@ ors was a must .
numerous schools were ext@@ ingu@@ ished due to various circumstances .
tendai shom@@ yo developed independently , in accordance with what saicho had introduced .
after saicho , en@@ nin and ann@@ en made it prosper@@ ous .
ry@@ onin , the founder of yu@@ z@@ un@@ em@@ butsu-@@ shu sect , is known as the patri@@ arch of the restoration .
in 110@@ 9 , ry@@ onin built rai@@ go@@ in temple -lrb- sakyo ward , kyoto city -rrb- in ohara , kyoto .
rai@@ go@@ in temple , in ohara , was called gyo@@ zan as the temple ` s title , having been named after gyo@@ zan , the birthplace of shom@@ yo in china .
before long , rai@@ go@@ in temple and shor@@ inin temple were known as the do@@ jo@@ s of ohara school gyo@@ zan shom@@ yo .
j@@ ak@@ ug@@ en developed a school later , so there were two schools of shom@@ yo in ohara .
subsequently , sh@@ ukai restored ohara shom@@ yo .
tan@@ chi established a stream based on a new form of music theory .
since then , it became the center of tendai shom@@ yo , and it has been inherited by the present tendai shom@@ yo .
the yu@@ z@@ un@@ em@@ butsu-@@ shu sect , jod@@ o-@@ shu sect and jodo shinshu sect represent the lineage of tendai shom@@ yo .
shingon shom@@ yo has been passed down to the present day based on what kukai introduced .
shom@@ yo was system@@ at@@ ized after shin@@ ga .
particularly , kan@@ cho was known as the patri@@ arch of the restoration .
he worked on the composition and control of shom@@ yo .
there were numerous schools until the kamakura period , but the princ@@ ely priest kaku@@ sho reorganized them into four : the hon@@ so@@ in@@ ryu school , shin@@ so@@ in@@ ryu school , dai@@ gor@@ yu school and nakag@@ awa-@@ dai@@ shin@@ ryu school .
shom@@ yo , of the kog@@ i -lrb- old -rrb- shin@@ gon@@ shu sect , declined and became extinc@@ t with the emer@@ gen@@ ce of the edo period .
the hon@@ so@@ in@@ ryu school , shin@@ so@@ in@@ ryu school and dai@@ gor@@ yu school were ext@@ ingu@@ ished by the middle of the meiji period .
currently , it is divided into chi@@ zan shom@@ yo -lrb- chi@@ shaku@@ in , kyoto -rrb- , bu@@ zan shom@@ yo -lrb- has@@ e-@@ dera temple , nara -rrb- , nan@@ zan-@@ shin@@ ryu school -lrb- mt . ko@@ ya-@@ san and kog@@ i shin@@ gon@@ shu sect temples , kyoto -rrb- .
chi@@ zan shom@@ yo and bu@@ zan shom@@ yo -lrb- shin@@ gi -lrb- new -rrb- shin@@ gon@@ shu sect shom@@ yo -rrb- : shom@@ yo of chi@@ zan-@@ ha buddhi@@ sts , shing@@ on-@@ shu sect and that of bu@@ zan-@@ ha buddhi@@ sts , shing@@ on-@@ shu sect were originally derived from the nakag@@ awa-@@ dai@@ shin@@ ryu school .
rai@@ yu took in the traditional school of daigo .
in 1585 , when ne@@ gor@@ o-ji temple -lrb- wakayama prefecture -rrb- was burned down by hideyoshi toyotomi and went into decline , the chi@@ zan and bu@@ zan schools formed a school based on the traditional school of daigo .
it features bu@@ zan ` s ` log@@ ic ` and chi@@ zan ` s ` shom@@ yo . `
nan@@ zan-@@ shin@@ ryu school -lrb- kog@@ i shin@@ gon@@ shu sect shom@@ yo -rrb- : this school is based on the nakag@@ awa-@@ dai@@ shin@@ ryu school .
the nakag@@ awa-@@ dai@@ shin@@ ryu school has dai@@ shin , of nak@@ a-@@ no@@ -g@@ aw@@ ad@@ era temple , nara , as the founder of the school .
during the years 12@@ 32 and 12@@ 33 , sh@@ oshin , of san@@ bo@@ in temple in reng@@ e-@@ dan@@ i -lrb- mt . ko@@ ya-@@ san -rrb- , moved his strong@@ hold to mt . ko@@ ya-@@ san .
later , it was called the nan@@ zan-@@ shin@@ ryu school , being named after nan@@ zan , another name for mt . ko@@ ya-@@ san .
it is also called the shin@@ ryu school or the yasan shin@@ ryu school .
the music of hei@@ kyoku , yok@@ yoku , min@@ yo or joruri can be said to be vari@@ ations of shom@@ yo .
its has had a great impact on mon@@ op@@ hon@@ y -lrb- un@@ accompanied music -rrb- .
emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb-
male
empress suiko -lrb- 6@@ 26 -rrb- - emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- -lrb- january 10 , 672 -rrb-
the 3@@ 8th emperor
kokufu shi@@ go is am@@ em@@ ik@@ oto hirak@@ a@@ su@@ wake no mikoto / amat@@ sum@@ ik@@ oto sak@@ iw@@ ake no mikoto
the first name is kaz@@ ur@@ aki -lrb- katsuragi -rrb- .
it is presumed that he was once called kaz@@ ur@@ aki no miko -lrb- katsuragi no miko -rrb- .
he is generally known as nak@@ ano oe no oji -lrb- naka no oe no miko -rrb- .
the `` oe `` means `` prince , `` and `` nak@@ ano oe `` means `` second prince . ``
over@@ view
he was the second prince of emperor j@@ ome .
the mother was tak@@ ara no himemiko -lrb- later called empress kog@@ yoku -rrb- .
the empress was yamat@@ ohime no okimi , daughter of emperor ` s half-brother , fur@@ uhito no oe no miko .
the emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- plot@@ ted a rebellion with nakatomi no kam@@ atari and seized power in a coup to kill soga no ir@@ uka , by which his uncle emperor kotoku came to power and he became a prince .
he established a new era -- the taika -- and made many reforms during this period -lrb- he was a key person in the taika reforms and it@@ sushi no hen -rrb- .
he dev@@ ised a plan to tr@@ ap an opposition group that included arima no miko , who might have caused a coup in the future , and they were executed .
as baekje was destroyed by the silla -lrb- kingdom -rrb- and tang in 6@@ 60 , the baekje prince , bu@@ yeo pun@@ g , who was staying at the imperial court , was sent back to his country to save baekje .
the emperor stayed at tsukushi to send cover@@ t troops to baekje , but empress sai@@ mei died in 6@@ 61 .
eventually , the emperor took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony , but then he was severely defeated in the battle of haku@@ suk@@ in@@ oe and moved to otsu city to be enthroned in 6@@ 63 .
after the battle of haku@@ suk@@ in@@ oe a castle surrounded by water was built , and nor@@ oshi and sak@@ imori -lrb- the con@@ script soldier system in the old days -rrb- were organized to protect the territory .
moreover , the system of ranking officials was changed from 19 lev@@ els to 26 lev@@ els .
in 6@@ 70 the first national family regist@@ ry , `` ko@@ go-@@ nen@@ jaku , `` was introduced .
according to `` chronicles of japan -lrb- nihon shoki -rrb- , `` the emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- wanted the first prince , otomo no miko , to be his successor .
however , after the death of emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- his brother , oama no miko -lrb- emperor tem@@ mu -rrb- , defeated otomo no miko in the jinshin war -lrb- the jinshin disturbance -rrb- and was enthroned .
subsequently , emperor tem@@ mu ` s ancest@@ ry remained in power until empress shotoku .
after the death of empress shotoku , s@@ ir@@ ak@@ abe no okimi , a grandchild of emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- was enthroned as emperor konin and subsequently emperor tenchi ` s -lrb- ten@@ ji ` s -rrb- ancest@@ ry stayed in power .
it is said that because emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- took nuk@@ ata no okimi away from oama no miko -lrb- emperor tem@@ mu -rrb- , he sent his four daughters to oama no miko -lrb- emperor tem@@ mu -rrb- to become princesses for an exp@@ i@@ ation .
brief personal history
born in 6@@ 26
rit@@ taishi -lrb- the ceremony to institute the crown prince -rrb- was held on july 15 , 6@@ 45 .
politics began without having an enthronement ceremony august 27 , 6@@ 61 .
the enthronement was held on february 23 , 6@@ 68 .
he died on january 10 , 672 at age 46 .
-lrb- according to `` fus@@ o@@ -r@@ yak@@ ki `` , he died from an illness , but another explanation that has been offered is that he went missing in the mountains and that emperor tem@@ mu had him assassinated . -rrb-
it was one of the myst@@ eries of the mid-@@ seventh century that emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- did not stay in power for a long time .
various theories have been suggested in regard to the matter .
this was the consideration for setting up emperor tem@@ mu ` s back@@ b@@ one .
there was an accepted theory that emperor tem@@ mu was a younger brother of emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- , but this is denied ; another theory is that emperor tem@@ mu was aya no miko , whom empress kog@@ yoku had before she married emperor jom@@ ei , and that he was an older half-brother of emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- .
it is appar@@ ent that emperor tem@@ mu was older than emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- after trac@@ ing back their ages according to the emperor tenchi ` s -lrb- ten@@ ji ` s -rrb- age at death in `` chronicles of japan -lrb- nihon shoki -rrb- `` and the emperor tem@@ mu ` s age at death in other history books .
the information is consist@@ ent in the same historical records , and there are eight to nine years of age difference between the two emperors .
some people say that emperor tem@@ mu ` s age was pur@@ pos@@ ely fal@@ s@@ ified since it was an em@@ bar@@ r@@ ass@@ ing fact that the younger brother became the emperor before his older brother even though they are half-@@ brothers with the same mother ; but some arg@@ ue that according to `` chronicles of japan -lrb- nihon shoki -rrb- , `` emperor tem@@ mu ` s age was 16 when his father , emperor jom@@ ei , was enthroned , but it was said that he was 16 when his father died .
therefore , the emperor ` s real year of birth is 6@@ 14 , according to the royal family tree -lrb- hon@@ cho-@@ ko@@ in-@@ jo@@ un@@ roku -rrb- .
it was usual to have no successor to the imperial throne for some period -lrb- in fact , emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- and empress jito , who were in power before and after emperor tem@@ mu , took control of the government without having an enthronement ceremony -rrb- .
some arg@@ ue that this caused the er@@ rors in their ages .
some people have said that because `` chronicles of japan -lrb- nihon shoki -rrb- `` and other indicated history books are edited in different years and they are different in character , they can not be treated al@@ ike . ``
please refer to the section `` the age of emperor tem@@ mu . ``
there is a theory that the is@@ shi no hen was a coup caused by karu no miko -lrb- emperor kotoku -rrb- , in which naka no oe no oji -lrb- naka no oe no miko -rrb- lost his position .
it has recently been indicated that naka no oe no oji -lrb- naka no oe no miko -rrb- and sog@@ ano ir@@ uka had a relatively good relationship and similar basic policies .
this way there is no reason that naka no oe no oji -lrb- naka no oe no miko -rrb- would have assassinated ir@@ uka .
because there is fal@@ s@@ ification in the definition of taika ` s reform in `` chronicles of japan -lrb- nihon shoki -rrb- , `` this theory has become appar@@ ent .
this theory gets a lot of attention because it can expl@@ ain empress kog@@ yoku ` s abdic@@ ation or the reason that the soga family -lrb- except ir@@ uka -rrb- was not dis@@ placed from politics after the coup .
there is a theory that the enthronement of emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- was del@@ ayed due to the compl@@ ain@@ ts against his relationship with women .
this is based on the theory that emperor kotoku sent a poem to his wife hashi@@ hito no himemiko -lrb- emperor tenchi ` s -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- sister with the same mother -rrb- indicating that emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- was having an affair with her , which is contained in `` chronicles of japan -lrb- nihon shoki -rrb- . ``
in those days , ro@@ man@@ ce and marriage were allowed between half-@@ sisters and brothers from different mo@@ thers but not between half-@@ brothers and sisters from the same mother ; however , in the comic story `` ten@@ jo no ni@@ ji -lrb- the rain@@ bow in the sky -rrb- , `` by machi@@ ko sat@@ on@@ aka , it is described that there was a ro@@ man@@ ce invol@@ ving this kind of forbid@@ den love ; hashi@@ hito no himemiko was persu@@ aded to marry with karu no miko -lrb- emperor kotoku -rrb- , but she kept the relationship with emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- , and arima no miko was fur@@ ious after know@@ ing this and became angry at hashi@@ hito no himemiko .
there is a theory that hashi@@ hito no himemiko ascended the throne as the princess of the previous emperor but one and became an empress after the death of empress sai@@ mei ; however , for some reason her name was er@@ ased from the record .
in the man ` yoshu -lrb- `` the anthology of my@@ ri@@ ad leaves -rrb- , `` `` nak@@ atsu@@ sum@@ er@@ a-@@ mikoto `` is considered to be hashi@@ hito no himemiko , and it is said that the one named `` nak@@ atsu@@ sum@@ er@@ a-@@ mikoto `` was a temporary emperor until the enthronement of emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- .
if hashi@@ hito no himemiko was the same person as `` nak@@ atsu@@ sum@@ er@@ a-@@ mikoto , `` there is a question why only she had this special name ; alternat@@ ively , it is said that this name could have been for empress sai@@ mei , but there is no pro@@ of .
it is hard to prov@@ e , since this is about political history with limited data ; however , it is expected to have cl@@ ear@@ er information from close study in relation to the fin@@ dings of archae@@ ology .
poems
the emperor tenchi -lrb- ten@@ ji -rrb- was a poet who had four poems in `` man ` yoshu -lrb- the anthology of my@@ ri@@ ad leaves -rrb- . ``
he was respected as the emperor of the heian dynasty , and one of his poems is found at the beginning of `` one hundred waka poems -lrb- the ogura anthology of one hundred tan@@ ka-@@ poems by one hundred poets -rrb- . ``
i am sitting in the bar@@ n next to a rice field when rice is harv@@ ested in the autumn and my kimono sleeves get wet by night de@@ w , as the roof of the bar@@ n is covered with rough@@ -@@ bl@@ aded ha@@ y .
the following poem is from `` man ` yoshu -lrb- the anthology of my@@ ri@@ ad leaves -rrb- . ``
in ancient days , mt . kag@@ u-@@ yama loved mt . un@@ eb@@ i-@@ yama and fought against mt . m@@ imin@@ ashi-@@ yama for love ; there is no doub@@ t we still fight for love between wives , as it has been the same since the age of the gods .
the saionji family were court nobility descended from the fujiwara clan .
the saionji family was of the fujiwara clan fuji@@ war@@ a-@@ hokke kan@@ in@@ ryu , and the kak@@ aku -lrb- family rank of court nobility -rrb- was the se@@ iga family .
the toin family and imadegawa / kik@@ utei family were branch families of the saionji family .
there was a samurai family -- the saionji clan in i@@ yo-@@ no-@@ kuni -- as a major off@@ shoot that used the saionji surname .
the family crest is hi@@ dar@@ i-@@ mitsu@@ dom@@ oe .
the pro@@ gen@@ itor of the saionji family was fujiwara no michi@@ sue , the third son of fujiwara no kim@@ izane .
kin@@ tsune saionji , who was a great grandson of michi@@ sue , was confined by the imperial court during the jok@@ yu-@@ no@@ -r@@ an war because , having married the ni@@ ec@@ e of minamoto no yoritomo , he was being wat@@ ched over as a relative of the kamakura bakufu -lrb- japanese feudal government headed by a shogun -rrb- ; after the war , however , kin@@ tsune gained the conf@@ idence of the shogunate , wi@@ elded the real power in the imperial court through holding the office of kanto m@@ oshi@@ t@@ sugi , and rose to the position of daijo daijin -lrb- grand minister of state -rrb- , raising the social standing of the saionji family .
the family name of saionji comes from the name of the temple kin@@ tsune built at bet@@ tei , in kyoto -lrb- kita@@ yama-@@ so , kad@@ ono-@@ gun , yamashi@@ ro@@ -no-@@ kuni -rrb- .
this hall is also called kita@@ yama-@@ dono palace , and the current kin@@ kaku-ji temple was built by yoshimitsu ashikaga after he was given this land by the saionji family .
since the generation of kin@@ tsune , the saionji family gained support from the kamakura shogunate and came to power that sur@@ passed the sek@@ ke throughout the kamakura era .
sane@@ kane saionji appro@@ ached daik@@ aku-ji through genealogy and made his daughters marry kameyama ho-@@ ou , the ex@@ -@@ emperor , or the emperor godaigo .
however , since the generation of sane@@ kane ` s son kin@@ hira saionji , the saionji family this time supported the jimyo@@ in-@@ to genealogy when the dai@@ kaku@@ ji-@@ to genealogy started to keep a distance from the bakufu , thereby deep@@ ening the conflict with the dai@@ kaku@@ ji-@@ to genealogy .
thereafter , at the generation of kin@@ mune saionji , the saionji family was dismissed from the post of kanto m@@ oshi@@ t@@ sugi after the fall of the kamakura shogunate .
kin@@ mune har@@ bor@@ ed yasu@@ ie hojo , who was a remn@@ ant of the hojo clan , the assassinated emperor godaigo , who had started ken@@ mu@@ -no-@@ shin@@ sei ; plot@@ ted a rebellion to back the ex@@ -@@ emperor go@@ fushimi of jimyo@@ in-@@ to genealogy ; and was arrested and executed , the plot having been exposed by the betr@@ ay@@ al of kin@@ mune ` s younger brother , kin@@ shige saionji .
during the period of the northern and southern courts , kin@@ mune ` s son sanet@@ oshi saionji served hoku@@ cho -lrb- japan -rrb- and rose to the post of minister of the right , whereby the family name was restored .
during the muromachi and edo periods the saionji family was also known for having biwa -lrb- japanese l@@ ute -rrb- players as a family business .
in the early days of the edo period , sane@@ haru saionji welcomed toku@@ hime , who was the eldest daughter of ky@@ um@@ u nagaoka -lrb- also known as tadataka hosokawa -rrb- , as the mid@@ ai@@ dokoro -lrb- wife of a shogun or a high@@ est@@ -ranking nob@@ lem@@ an -rrb- of the heir -lrb- later dis@@ inherited -rrb- of tadaoki hosokawa , and invited her to accept the post of sadaijin -lrb- minister of the left -rrb- ; moreover , ky@@ um@@ u nagaoka offered various forms of financial support to the saionji family , including don@@ ating a property that yi@@ elded 600 koku of rice -lrb- men@@ ko-@@ shu@@ roku -rrb- .
at the end of the edo period , kin@@ mochi saionji was adopted from the tokudaiji family of the same kan@@ in@@ ryu , worked as a politician after the meiji restoration , served as prime minister , and had great influence as a gen@@ ro on the political scene during the taisho and showa eras .
there is an anecdote that kin@@ mochi was not good at playing the biwa japanese l@@ ute , which should have been the family business of the saionji family , and during kin@@ mochi ` s time in office as prime minister , the emperor meiji said out of mis@@ chief to kin@@ mochi , `` for the first time in a long while , i would like to list@@ en to biwa japanese l@@ ute , `` and therefore he was forced to play the biwa japanese l@@ ute in d@@ ire dist@@ ress together with the officials of ut@@ aryo in the imperial household ministry .
mt . hiei is a mountain that str@@ add@@ les the western part of otsu city in shiga prefecture and the north@@ eastern part of kyoto city in kyoto prefecture .
mt . hiei is the name for the so@@ ji ridge , which is formed by two pe@@ ak@@ s : dai@@ hiei -lrb- 8@@ 4@@ 8@@ .@@ 3 m -rrb- on the border between otsu city and kyoto city ` s sakyo ward ; and shi@@ me@@ ig@@ atake in sakyo ward -lrb- 8@@ 38 m -rrb- .
dai@@ hiei ` s first@@ -@@ order tri@@ ang@@ ulation point is located in otsu city .
next to mt . koya , it has long been an object of religious belief , flour@@ ishing with enryaku-ji temple and hi@@ yoshi taisha shrine on it .
it is part of the higashiyama mountains -lrb- kyoto prefecture -rrb- .
it is also known as eizan , hoku@@ rei , ten@@ dai@@ san , miyak@@ o@@ fuji , etc .
over@@ view
because of its location near the kim@@ on gate on the nor@@ theast side of kyoto , mt . hiei is considered a castle guardian .
the kojiki -lrb- records of ancient matters -rrb- cal@@ ls mt . hiei ` hi@@ en@@ oyama ` , and records that o@@ yam@@ aku@@ i no kami is enshrined on hi@@ en@@ oyama in omi province , and nar@@ ik@@ ab@@ ura is the object of worship .
ever since enryaku-ji temple was founded on hi@@ en@@ oyama , o@@ yam@@ aku@@ i no kami , as the god of the land , has been a guardian deity of the tendai sect and enryaku-ji temple ; and a mountain@@ -@@ king sect based on him has spread in the area .
also , it is the mountain where enryaku-ji temple ` s thousan@@ d@@ -day circum@@ am@@ bul@@ ation practice is done , including a pilgrimage to the shrines at the peak of mt . hiei , and to hi@@ yoshi taisha shrine at its foot .
hi@@ king is popular , and a famous tr@@ ail beg@@ ins at shug@@ akuin in sakyo ward of kyoto city and goes up kir@@ ar@@ az@@ aka hill ; another one on the shiga prefecture side beg@@ ins in mon@@ zen@@ machi , sakamoto -lrb- otsu city -rrb- , and goes up through m@@ ud@@ o@@ jid@@ ani valley .
the path on kir@@ ar@@ az@@ aka hill has long been used by monks , monk soldiers and imperial mes@@ seng@@ ers traveling between kyoto and enryaku-ji temple , and is still visited by many hik@@ ers today .
the tokaido nature tr@@ ail passes through the mountain on the way from otsu to kyoto / ohara .
many tourists come on holidays , since they can reach the top via t@@ ol@@ l road , c@@ able car , and ro@@ pe@@ way .
there used to be a mt . hiei am@@ us@@ ement park and a mt . hiei art@@ ific@@ ial s@@ ki slope , but both were closed before 2002 ; the site of the s@@ ki slope is now a c@@ os@@ mo@@ s flower garden , and there is an art museum - hiei garden museum - on the former location of the am@@ us@@ ement park .
there was also a forest land am@@ us@@ ement park in y@@ ase , at the foot of the mountain on the kyoto side , although that was closed on november 30 , 2001 , and a mem@@ ber@@ s-@@ only resor@@ t hotel now stands in that location .
dai@@ hiei and shi@@ me@@ ig@@ atake
the survey fin@@ dings from the ge@@ ographical survey institute show the eastern peak as dai@@ hiei , the western peak as shi@@ me@@ ig@@ atake , and both of them together as mt . hiei .
according to `` ten no ki `` -lrb- the record of survey -rrb- , the first@@ -@@ order tri@@ ang@@ ulation point on the eastern peak is called `` mt . hiei `` .
although this mar@@ ker is located at the border between otsu and kyoto cities , it is inside otsu city .
when one views mt . hiei from the kyoto basin , it is difficult to see the dai@@ hiei peak , so some think that shi@@ me@@ ig@@ atake is the peak of mt . hiei .
the keifuku electric railroad eizan ro@@ pe@@ way has its hiei mountain@@ top station placed on the shi@@ me@@ ig@@ atake peak .
there are confl@@ ic@@ ting opinions as to the proper way to write and read `` shi@@ me@@ ig@@ atake `` ; the g@@ s@@ i l@@ ists shi@@ me@@ ig@@ atake / shi@@ me@@ id@@ ake , while `` place names of kyoto `` l@@ ists shi@@ me@@ ig@@ atake and shi@@ myo no mine .
mt . hiei gets its alternate names , mt . tendai and shi@@ me@@ ig@@ atake , from mt . ti@@ ant@@ ai and mt . sim@@ ing , sacred mountains in the people ` s republic of china that have associ@@ ations with the tendai sect .

`` the pil@@ low book `` is a zui@@ hitsu ess@@ ay -lrb- literally , `` ran@@ dom jo@@ t@@ tings `` -rrb- , which is said to have been written by sei shonagon , a female writer who lived in the mid-heian period .

it was also called `` sei shonagon ki . ``
together with `` the tale of genji , `` this book is considered one of the tw@@ in master@@ pieces of heian literature , and it had a great influence on the renga -lrb- linked verse -rrb- , haikai -lrb- sevent@@ e@@ en-@@ syllable verse -rrb- , and kan@@ az@@ oshi -lrb- old stories wit@@ ten in the kana script -rrb- that followed .

according to an after@@ word to the book , her mo@@ tive for writing the book and the origin of the title came from the episode in which , when naidaijin -lrb- minister of the center -rrb- fujiwara no kore@@ chika presented to his younger sister fujiwara no empress teishi and emperor ichijo a bund@@ le of paper , which was still expensive in those days , the empress in@@ qu@@ ired , ` emperor used the paper to copy `` shiki -lrb- records of the grand histor@@ ian -rrb- , ` what do you think we could write on this ? `` to which sei shonagon answ@@ ered , ` it -lrb- the book -rrb- would be good to use as a pil@@ low . `
she was granted the paper -lrb- such episode being based on san@@ kan@@ bon -lrb- version of manuscript -rrb- , and both in@@ complete and complete ver@@ sions of no@@ in@@ bon -lrb- version of manuscript -rrb- have similar epis@@ od@@ es describing the response that `` it -lrb- the book -rrb- would be good to use as a pil@@ low -rrb- , `` but the sakai@@ bon and ma@@ ed@@ ab@@ on -lrb- ver@@ sions of the manuscript -rrb- don ` t contain this episode -rrb- .
it is widely thought that the title ` the pil@@ low book ` is also based on the episode .
`` a study of the pil@@ low book `` written by kazu@@ hiko hayashi ment@@ ions his own view and some other past scholars ` names such as kei@@ chu , shin@@ obu or@@ ik@@ uchi , and kik@@ an ikeda .
the following are typical views about the meaning of `` pil@@ low `` :

― mem@@ or@@ and@@ um : she kept the paper by her pil@@ low for private jo@@ t@@ tings .

however , scholars have yet to reach a con@@ sen@@ sus .
also , in the book of `` eiga monogatari -lrb- a tale of flow@@ ering fortun@@ es -rrb- , `` the term ` m@@ akura no soshi ` as a common n@@ oun was used to describe the beautiful kas@@ ane -lrb- lay@@ ering -rrb- colors .
according to the after@@ word , the first draft was written around 99@@ 6 , and sa@@ chujo -lrb- guard of the imperial palace -rrb- minamoto no tsune@@ fusa took the draft from the author ` s residence and brought it before the eyes of the world .
after that , she wrote continuously , and some records say the book was written around 10@@ 12 .
some lines of `` the pil@@ low book , `` as quoted from the old commentary `` shi@@ mei@@ -@@ sho commentary of ` the tale of genji , ` `` don ` t exist in the surviving manuscript , which suggests that the writing process was complicated .

it is an important cultural property .
it was copied during the early kamakura period and is considered to be the oldest of all the manuscripts of `` the pil@@ low book . ``
among them , the sakai@@ bon group gok@@ og@@ on@@ in@@ bon was separately collected in two volumes of `` gun@@ shor@@ u@@ i@@ ju -lrb- japanese history book -rrb- , `` and three kinds of sakai@@ bon were collected in `` shinko gun@@ shor@@ u@@ i@@ ju -lrb- library -rrb- . ``
additionally , no@@ in@@ bon was used as a master copy in making the old plate of type in the early edo period ; therefore , it remained a dominant manuscript along with `` the pil@@ low book bo@@ chu -lrb- mar@@ gin@@ al notes -rrb- `` and `` shun@@ sho-@@ sho commentary of the pil@@ low book `` -lrb- an@@ not@@ ated by k@@ ig@@ in kit@@ amura -rrb- until modern times .
however , in 1946 , when jut@@ aro tanaka -lrb- 19@@ 17@@ -@@ 1987 -rrb- re@@ evaluated the second class of san@@ kan@@ bon , it came to be considered more important and was published more , being used as a text@@ book and read at school after the war .
other exist@@ ent manuscripts are seven chapters of `` the pil@@ low book e@@ kotoba -lrb- story in pictures -rrb- `` made in the late kamakura period , consisting of emaki -lrb- a picture scroll -rrb- with haku@@ byo@@ ga -lrb- ink line painting -rrb- , and san@@ kan@@ bon manuscript seems to have been used for the notes .
the secon@@ d-@@ class san@@ kan@@ bon contains more than 300 independent chapters in total .
it consists of various types of writing : ` chapters of rui@@ ju ` of ` mon@@ ow@@ azuk@@ ushi -lrb- en@@ um@@ er@@ ating the things in the same category -rrb- , ` as represented by the l@@ ists of things like ` in@@ sects , ` ` flow@@ ering trees , ` ` disp@@ ir@@ iting things , ` ` en@@ de@@ ar@@ ingly lo@@ v@@ ely things , ` and ` chapters of zu@@ iso -lrb- ess@@ ay -rrb- , ` which is an observ@@ ation of daily life and nature in the seasons , and ` chapters of remin@@ isc@@ ence -lrb- chapters of a diary -rrb- ` in which the author wrote about the life around empress teishi , whom she served in the imperial court .
however , some chapters are too ob@@ sc@@ ure to be classified -lrb- for example the first chapter , entitled , ` the best time in spring is dawn , ` is generally classified into the chapters of zu@@ iso , but some people dis@@ ag@@ ree -rrb- .
it was written in the plain vern@@ ac@@ ular using hir@@ ag@@ ana -lrb- the japanese cur@@ sive syllabary -rrb- , and most of the chapters were written in a wit@@ ty style , but sometimes sent@@ im@@ ental lam@@ entation appears refl@@ ecting the fall of the michitaka fujiwara ` s family and un@@ happiness gone through by her maj@@ est@@ y empress teishi .
the author ` s sop@@ hi@@ stic@@ ated taste was in har@@ mon@@ y with a ke@@ en observ@@ ation on things , gener@@ ating the intell@@ ect@@ ual a@@ esth@@ etic world of ` w@@ ok@@ ashi -lrb- am@@ using or del@@ ight@@ ful -rrb- ` in contrast with the em@@ ot@@ ional ` mono no aware -lrb- pa@@ th@@ os -rrb- ` of `` the tale of genji . ``
posit@@ ive evalu@@ ation
in the pil@@ low book , the author cher@@ ished hum@@ an@@ ity as well as nature ; therefore , she accepted and formed them in each ph@@ ase as various beaut@@ ies -lrb- saku@@ wo me@@ kata -rrb- .
even in each chapter , various types of rich writing such as l@@ ists , ess@@ ays or remin@@ isc@@ ences are fre@@ ely inter@@ wo@@ v@@ en , like a flying horse so@@ ar@@ ing into the sky with a str@@ and of associ@@ ations called up one after another . -lrb- boku hag@@ it@@ ani -rrb-
although it followed the conventional ` spring - flower -@@ morning ` type of lin@@ k that was often seen in kok@@ in@@ shu in those days , its use of the ` seas@@ on-@@ time ` type of expression -lrb- such as ` the best time in spring is dawn ` -rrb- , which om@@ itted the middle poet@@ ic el@@ ement , was in@@ nov@@ ative , chall@@ eng@@ ing as it did the rig@@ id esth@@ etic val@@ ues held by read@@ ers who were familiar with poet@@ ic traditions . -lrb- munet@@ oshi fujim@@ oto -rrb-
she expressed her love and respect for empress teishi .
the author wrote it to con@@ so@@ le empress teishi , who felt de@@ pressed over the fall of the michitaka family .
therefore , it is natural that she didn ` t mention the fall of the michitaka family -lrb- as above -rrb- .
there are some chapters that seem like m@@ ere self-@@ prai@@ se , but in them the author claimed that the empress and the people around her received the emperor ` s favor and led a life filled with a@@ esth@@ etic sent@@ iment and ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite taste , living in a world that was cut off from the politics of the time and dis@@ appointment . -lrb- os@@ am@@ u ueno -rrb- .
neg@@ ative evalu@@ ation
it is a represent@@ ation of her sh@@ allow@@ ness trying to for@@ get her original social rank and ass@@ im@@ il@@ ate herself to the upper class . -lrb- ken aki@@ yama -rrb-
-lrb- it is based on the fact that she didn ` t use polit@@ e expressions when she wrote , not only about her family but also about those who belonged to the upper classes . -rrb-
it is only ` a record of civ@@ ilization in the inner palace , ` and was@@ n ` t written by ` a private individual ` -lrb- jo@@ ji ishida -rrb- .
yoshinobu -lrb- yoshihisa -rrb- tokugawa was the 15th seii taishogun of the edo shogunate -lrb- held the position from december 5 , 1866 to december 9 , 1867 , both in the old lunar calendar -rrb- .
he was the only shogun who did not work in edo-jo castle .
his rank awarded by the imperial court was naidaijin -lrb- inner minister -rrb- ju-@@ ichii kun@@ -@@ it@@ to ko@@ shaku .
he was a member of the house of peers of japan .
he served as the guardian -lrb- shogun kok@@ en@@ shoku -rrb- of the 14th shogun iemochi tokugawa ; after iemochi ` s death he assumed his position as the 15th shogun of the edo shogunate .
after he returned his right to ad@@ minister government to emperor meiji -lrb- taisei hokan -rrb- , he worked aiming to un@@ ite the nobles and samurai -lrb- ko@@ bu g@@ att@@ ai -rrb- ; however , during the battle of toba-@@ fushimi that took place after the restoration of imperial rule -lrb- os@@ ei fuk@@ ko -rrb- , he left the shogunate army behind at osaka-jo castle and returned to edo-jo castle ; thereafter , he received a subjugation order from the imperial court and entered into discipl@@ inary confin@@ ement which led to the blood@@ less surrender of edo-jo castle .
after being fre@@ ed from the discipl@@ inary confin@@ ement , he im@@ mer@@ sed himself in his ho@@ b@@ b@@ ies ; he was awarded the title of ko@@ shaku and lived into the taisho period .
the name `` yoshinobu `` is also pop@@ ularly read as `` kei@@ ki `` -lrb- yus@@ oku-@@ yomi , the way of pron@@ oun@@ cing in the chin@@ ese-@@ derived reading , so as not to directly pron@@ oun@@ ce the real name of the resp@@ ect@@ able person in the japanese reading -rrb- .
there is a record among official documents of the edo shogunate that during his ten@@ ure as the shogun his name was also read as `` yoshihisa `` .
there are also records of his name written as `` yoshihisa `` with his own sig@@ nature using ro@@ man letters , and -lsb- his name printed as `` yoshihisa `` -rsb- in newspapers in english .
he is most often called `` yoshinobu `` in his hom@@ el@@ and of mito , but he is often called `` kei@@ ki `` in shizuoka , where he spent the rest of his life .
according to those who knew him in his lifetime , yoshinobu himself liked to be called `` kei@@ ki-@@ sama `` , and he called himself `` kei@@ ki `` in a tel@@ e@@ grap@@ h sent to his younger brother , akit@@ ake tokugawa .
yoshihisa tokugawa , who was yoshinobu ` s heir , was also called `` kei@@ kyu@@ -@@ sama `` from those around him .
the use of the two names `` kei@@ ki-@@ sama `` and `` kei@@ ki-@@ san `` has been confirmed , and even though it seems to have become un@@ common in the modern days , the use of `` kei@@ ki-@@ san `` is not limited to shizuoka but is confirmed in various regions ; in both cases the name is often used with much aff@@ ection .
though ryo@@ taro shiba comm@@ ented that `` the name ` kei@@ ki ` was used quite often among those associated with the former shogunate `` , the use of the name `` kei@@ ki `` was also confirmed among those related to hi@@ go-@@ han clan who worked toward the fall of the shogunate ; there is a possibility that he was widely yet secretly respected and adm@@ ired .
he was born at the mit@@ o-@@ han clan residence of ko@@ ishikawa in edo , as the seventh son of the ninth chief -lsb- of mit@@ o-@@ han clan -rsb- , nari@@ aki tokugawa on september 29 , 18@@ 37 .
his mother was -lsb- his father ` s -rsb- legitimate wife , princess yoshiko -lrb- he was the first shogun since the third shogun iemitsu tokugawa whose biological mother was the father ` s legitimate wife .
however , although iemitsu ` s biological mother is officially known as the father hidetada ` s legitimate wife , og@@ o no kata , but one theory suggests that his biological mother was kasuga no tsubone -rrb- .
his childhood name was shichi@@ ro@@ maro .
based on nari@@ aki ` s educational policy , `` a boy should be educ@@ ated in his home domain `` yoshinobu moved to mito at the age of seven months and spent most of his time there until he succeeded to the hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi tokugawa family , during which time he was educ@@ ated and taught martial arts by se@@ ishi@@ sai ai@@ zawa .
yoshinobu ` s intell@@ ig@@ ence was noted early ; at first , instead of sending him to another family for adoption , nari@@ aki planned to keep him by his eldest son and heir , yoshi@@ atsu tokugawa ` s side .
on august 1 , 184@@ 7 , the shogunate gave a secret order to design@@ ate shichi@@ ro@@ maro of mit@@ o-@@ han clan as the heir to the hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi family , one of the three branches of the tok@@ ug@@ awa-@@ han clan -lrb- gosan@@ kyo -rrb- .
accep@@ ting this order , shichi@@ ro@@ maro succeeded to the hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi family on september 1 ; in december , he received hen@@ ki -lrb- one character of shogun ` s name : 慶 -rrb- from the 12th shogun ie@@ yoshi -lrb- 家@@ 慶 -rrb- tokugawa and changed his name to yoshinobu -lrb- 慶@@ 喜 -rrb- .
considering yoshinobu as a strong candid@@ ate as the heir to the shogun , ie@@ yoshi visited the hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi residence often , but he abandoned this idea after accep@@ ting roju masahiro abe ` s ad@@ mon@@ ishing advice .
during the dis@@ order caused by the arrival of the black ships , shogun ie@@ yoshi died in 185@@ 3 ; his heir , the 13th shogun iesada tokugawa , had poor health with no pro@@ spec@@ t of having his own son , and therefore the issue of `` who would become the shogun ` s heir `` arose -lrb- issue of shogun ` s heir -rrb- .
there was an opposition between the hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi-@@ party that included nari@@ aki , masahiro abe and the chief of sat@@ suma-@@ han clan , nari@@ akira shimazu , who recommended yoshinobu , and the nan@@ ki-@@ party prim@@ arily consisting of the chief of hi@@ kon@@ e-@@ han clan , naosuke ii , and the o@@ oku members headed by iesada ` s birth@@ -@@ mother , hon@@ juin , who recommended the chief of ki@@ i-@@ han clan , yoshi@@ tomi tokugawa .
the hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi-@@ party executed political man@@ eu@@ vers such as sending into o@@ oku nari@@ akira shimazu ` s adopted daughter , ten@@ shoin , as shogun ` s wife -lrb- mid@@ ai@@ dokoro -rrb- , but after the death of masahiro abe and nari@@ akira shimazu , its power weak@@ ened ; naosuke ii who became tairo in 1858 settled on `` shogun ` s heir as yoshi@@ tomi tokugawa `` through ar@@ bit@@ ration .
in the same year , naosuke ii signed the treaty of amity and commerce between the united states and japan without the emperor ` s permission .
yoshinobu , along with nari@@ aki and the chief of fuku@@ i-@@ han clan , yoshinaga matsudaira , made an un@@ expected visit to the -lsb- edo-jo -rsb- castle and closely inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ated naosuke , but in ter@@ n , he was quest@@ ioned on his off@@ ense of making an un@@ expected visit to the castle ; he was ordered to ret@@ ire and was given a discipl@@ inary confin@@ ement in the following year -lrb- 185@@ 9 -rrb- -lrb- ansei pur@@ ge -rrb- .
yoshinobu himself seemed to be un@@ interested in becoming the heir to the shogun and he sent a letter to nari@@ aki whose content indicated `` i appreci@@ ate your efforts but i ` d rather not become the shogun than to make mist@@ akes after becoming the shogun . ``
he was reli@@ ev@@ ed from his discipl@@ inary confin@@ ement in 186@@ 0 .
in 1862 , guarded by the sat@@ suma-@@ han clan army under the command of hisam@@ itsu shimazu , the emperor ` s messenger , shiget@@ omi ohara , entered edo and delivered emperor komei ` s order to `` promote yoshinobu tokugawa to the shogun ` s guardian -lrb- shogun kok@@ en@@ shoku -rrb- and shun@@ gaku -lrb- yoshinaga -rrb- matsudaira to tairo . ``
on july 6 , the shogunate ordered yoshinobu to be the shogun ` s guardian -lrb- shogun kok@@ en@@ shoku -rrb- and shun@@ gaku to be the shogunal prime minister -lrb- sei@@ ji sos@@ ai@@ shoku -rrb- .
yoshinobu and shun@@ gaku directed a reform of the shogunate known as the bun@@ kyu reform that included inst@@ all@@ ation of the office of kyoto prot@@ ector -lrb- kyoto shugo@@ shoku -rrb- and rel@@ ax@@ ation of san@@ kin ko@@ tai requ@@ irement .
in 1863 , he went to kyoto as iemochi tokugawa ` s har@@ b@@ inger , and he end@@ ea@@ v@@ ored to negoti@@ ate with the members of the imperial court who ur@@ ged the execution of joi -lrb- expulsion of foreigners from japan -rrb- .
upon emperor komei ` s visit to iwashimizu hachiman-gu shrine to pray for the execution of joi , if iemochi received set@@ to -lrb- emperor ` s sword that symbol@@ ically author@@ izes the shogun to take charge of the up@@ coming battle on behalf of the emperor -rrb- from the emperor , he would have no cho@@ ice but to exec@@ ute joi ; yoshinobu quickly made iemochi canc@@ el the audience -lsb- with the emperor -rsb- by saying that iemochi had a cold and a f@@ ever -lrb- pret@@ ended illness -rrb- .
when the son@@ no joi party -lrb- the anti-@@ foreign@@ er ro@@ y@@ al@@ ists -rrb- centered around the cho@@ shu-@@ han clan lost their case upon the political change on august 18 , yoshinobu went to kyoto again in order to participate in a meeting jointly held by the party trying to un@@ ite the nobles and samurai -lrb- ko@@ bu g@@ att@@ ai -rrb- and the party assist@@ ing the shogunate -lrb- sab@@ aku -rrb- .
however , when no agreement was reached , he used a b@@ old method of negotiation ; he intent@@ ionally got dr@@ unk at a banquet with prince kuni asa@@ hiko and rev@@ iled at mun@@ en@@ ari date , shun@@ gaku matsudaira and hisam@@ itsu shimazu , and furthermore , viol@@ ently said to nakagawa no miya , `` how much is shimazu p@@ aying you ! `` so as to break@@ down their organization .
thereafter , he remained in kyoto and he was appointed to kin@@ ri go@@ shu@@ ei so@@ toku -lrb- head of the imperial palace / emperor ` s prot@@ ector -rrb- ; together with the prot@@ ector -lrb- shugo@@ shoku -rrb- kat@@ amori matsudaira -lrb- ai@@ zu-@@ han clan -rrb- and kyoto shoshidai sada@@ aki matsudaira -lrb- chief of ku@@ wan@@ a-@@ han clan -rrb- reg@@ ulated the nobles and those loyal to the emperor -lrb- ichi@@ -@@ kai-@@ so -lrb- hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi-@@ ai@@ zu-@@ kuw@@ ana -rrb- structure -rrb- .
during the tengu@@ to war he showed his cru@@ el@@ ty by sl@@ a@@ shing his supporters such as ko@@ un@@ sai takeda and the vassals of his home domain of mito .
at the kin@@ mon rebellion in 1864 he led the shogunate army and he himself attacked the choshu army that had occupied the takatsukasa residence .
after the first subjugation of choshu that followed , he made every effort to secure the emperor ` s permission on the treaty of amity and commerce between the un@@ it@@ es states and japan that had been left un@@ author@@ ized by the emperor ; he succeeded in sec@@ uring the emperor ` s author@@ ization al@@ be@@ it with provis@@ os .
at the second subjugation of choshu in 1866 , yoshinobu suppressed inter@@ fer@@ ences from sat@@ suma-@@ han clan and received a direct order from the emperor to subjug@@ ate choshu .
however , because of the sat@@ suma-@@ choshu alliance -lrb- sac@@ cho alliance -rrb- , sat@@ suma-@@ han clan refused to send its army and consequently the shogunate army had to retreat .
during the second subjugation of choshu , shogun iemochi passed away at osaka-jo castle on july 20 .
yoshinobu appe@@ aled to the imperial court to make an official announcement of tru@@ ce by the emperor and he succeeded in con@@ clud@@ ing an arm@@ ist@@ ice treaty .
he was recommended to be iemochi ` s successor but yoshinobu fir@@ mly declined .
he succeeded to the tokugawa shogun family on au@@ g . 20 but he continued to ref@@ use to assume his position as the shogun .
since then the roju -lrb- shogun ` s political advisor -rrb- and others s@@ inc@@ er@@ ely requested him to become the shogun , but he still did not accept the request ; he finally assumed his position as the shogun on december 5 , after accep@@ ting -lrb- emperor komei ` s -rrb- direct order to become the shogun .
by becoming the shogun as a favor to others he aimed to man@@ ip@@ ulate politics to his advantage .
through the french minister le@@ on ro@@ ches , he received 2.@@ 4 million dol@@ lar@@ s from france and founded yoko@@ suka ir@@ on@@ works , a shi@@ p@@ y@@ ard , and a ship repair doc@@ k , and he also led a revol@@ ution in the military system by inv@@ iting a group of military advis@@ ors headed by j@@ ul@@ es br@@ un@@ et .
he also sent his biological younger brother , akit@@ ake tokugawa , to the paris ex@@ position and encouraged the younger members of the shogunate vassals to study in europe .
on the matter of opening of port of hyogo , he ten@@ ac@@ iously persu@@ aded the imperial court and obtained the emperor ` s permission .
yoshinobu an@@ tic@@ ip@@ ated a secret order to sac@@ cho -lrb- satsuma and choshu -@@ han clans -rrb- from the emperor to destroy the shogunate , and on oc@@ t . 14 , 1867 , he -lrb- as a pre@@ emp@@ tive measure -rrb- suggested to the imperial court that he would return his political power to the emperor ; his request was accepted by the emperor on the 15th , the following day -lrb- taisei hokan -rrb- .
it is said that he jud@@ ged the imperial court at the time to have no cap@@ ability to ad@@ minister government , and he therefore sought continu@@ ation of tokugawa family ` s political power by leading the sess@@ ion of clan chief@@ s .
however , because of the anti-@@ shogunate activ@@ ists toshimichi okubo and tomomi iwakura ` s sch@@ eme , there was a command to rev@@ ive the political power of the imperial court in december , and yoshinobu was ordered `` jik@@ an no@@ chi `` -lrb- to res@@ ign from his position as naidaijin and surrender the tokugawa territory -rrb- .
in order to avoid confron@@ t@@ ations yoshinobu retreated to osaka-jo castle , assemb@@ led the amb@@ ass@@ ad@@ ors from various foreign countries and asser@@ ted the legit@@ im@@ acy of tokugawa ; furthermore , he appe@@ aled to the imperial court and had the jik@@ an no@@ chi modi@@ fied to more mod@@ er@@ ate terms .
however , in response to the prov@@ oc@@ ation caused by sat@@ suma-@@ han clan in the city of edo in 1868 he mob@@ ilized his army and bloc@@ k@@ aded kyoto using the armies of aizu and ku@@ wan@@ a-@@ han clans .
nevertheless , at the battle of toba fushimi that broke out on january 3 , even though the military force was holding up ad@@ equ@@ ately , he jud@@ ged that the former shogunate army was at a dis@@ advantage ; he abandoned his army and retreated to edo-jo castle abo@@ ard war@@ ship kai@@ yo maru .
soon an order was issued to subjug@@ ate yoshinobu as the enemy of the imperial court , and the imperial army led by general prince arisug@@ awa tar@@ uhito set off to the east .
yoshinobu suppressed the resistance party led by tadamasa og@@ uri and asser@@ ted to comp@@ ly with the order .
in february , he entrusted kai@@ shu katsu to take control of the situation and entered into a discipl@@ inary confin@@ ement at dai@@ ji@@ -in located in kan ` ei-ji temple in ueno .
furthermore , he passed on the estate of tok@@ ug@@ awa-@@ soke -lrb- the main branch of tokugawa family -rrb- to his adopted son kam@@ en@@ osuke t@@ ayasu -lrb- future i@@ es@@ ato tokugawa -rrb- .
the negotiation between katsu and the staff officer of the imperial army , takamori saigo , reached an agreement and blood@@ less surrender of edo-jo castle took place ; yoshinobu was moved to mito and he continued his discipl@@ inary confin@@ ement in a room within ko@@ dok@@ an of -lsb- mito -rsb- han -lrb- domain -rrb- school .
in july , -lsb- the entire -rsb- tokugawa family was relocated to sun@@ pu .

in september of 1869 yoshinobu ` s discipl@@ inary confin@@ ement was lif@@ ted as a result of the end of boshin war .
thereafter he did not participate in politics and spent his days im@@ mer@@ sed in his interests such as photograp@@ hy , hunting , net fishing , playing go and noh songs .
he moved to sug@@ amo , tokyo in 1897 .
in the following year he visited the imperial palace and had and audience with emperor meiji .
in 1902 he was bestowed a title of ko@@ shaku and he established the yoshinobu tokugawa family aside from the main branch of tokugawa family .
he passed on the family estate to yoshihisa tokugawa and he retired in 1910 .
he died of p@@ ne@@ umon@@ ia in 1913 .

he retired on december 8 .
he died -lrb- at 4 : 10 a.@@ m. -rrb- on november , 22 , 1913 .
on the same day , he was awarded ky@@ oku@@ jitsu toka dai@@ ju@@ sho .
as far as education and studying of martial arts are concerned , he was born and raised under the very best circum@@ stance ; among many forms of martial arts he was especially interested in and was an expert in shur@@ ik@@ en -lrb- d@@ ir@@ k-@@ throwing -rrb- .
even after taisei hokan , he practiced throwing the shur@@ ik@@ en every day until he was swe@@ ating , and he is counted as one of the most famous persons among the shur@@ ik@@ en experts .
he tos@@ sed about a lot in bed in his sle@@ ep , and his father , nari@@ aki tokugawa , thought that this would be a problem when he became the heir to the tokugawa family ; in order to correct this , r@@ az@@ or bl@@ ades were planted into his pil@@ low -lrb- this was done just to sc@@ are him , and in reality the r@@ az@@ or bl@@ ades were removed after he had fallen as@@ le@@ ep so as to prevent any in@@ jur@@ ies -rrb- .
on the other hand , there is an anecdote that in his adul@@ th@@ ood he sle@@ pt with his wife and a concubine so that the three of them formed the letter `` y `` as a measure against assassination attemp@@ ts .
there is supposed to be a photograp@@ h of yoshinobu from his early childhood , but because cam@@ eras were probably not yet introduced to japan at that time , it is doub@@ t@@ ful that the photograp@@ h is that of yoshinobu .
yoshinobu visited iemochi when he fell ill , and at this occasion it is said that they had a normal conver@@ s@@ ation .
his extraordinary talent was well known , and his father nari@@ aki tokugawa ` s conf@@ id@@ ant , tate@@ waki a@@ jima , comm@@ ented on him as `` someone who will pur@@ ify the tokugawa family line `` ; he sing@@ ly shou@@ ld@@ ered the expect@@ ation of restor@@ ing the shogunate ` s authority , and when his highly tou@@ ted ten@@ ure as the shogun began , his br@@ il@@ li@@ ance was praised as `` the return of ieyasu tokugawa `` .
yoshinobu ` s intell@@ ig@@ ence was well known even among the anti-@@ shogunate party , and takayoshi kido of cho@@ shu-@@ han clan in particular was on guard saying , `` yoshinobu hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi ` s dar@@ ing and intell@@ ig@@ ent strategy can not be under@@ estimated .
it is like seeing the return of ieyasu . ``
regarding the decision on taisei hokan , ryoma sakamoto said , `` my respected shogun , i won@@ der what you are feeling in your heart today .
i prai@@ se how you made the -lsb- difficult -rsb- decision , i prai@@ se how you made the -lsb- difficult -rsb- decision .
i make a vow to dedic@@ ate my life to the lord . `` ryoma highly praised yoshinobu and he even considered giving yoshinobu a position as assistant kanpaku in the new government .
however , yoshinobu did not learn about the existence of ryoma until the meiji era -lrb- after ryoma ` s death -rrb- .
yoshinobu was not the only person who did not know about ryoma ; ryoma ` s f@@ ame in his life time was very much smaller than that after the meiji restoration .
when he lost the battle of toba-@@ fushimi and retreated to edo , his enemies highly criticized him for `` running away in the face of the enemy `` .
there were people who made fun of yoshinobu for being a sp@@ in@@ eless c@@ ow@@ ard , poin@@ ting out that even though he left behind ieyasu ` s um@@ a@@ jir@@ ushi -lrb- sign belonging to the clan general / chief and used in a battle -rrb- of golden fan , he always had his bel@@ o@@ ved concubine with him .
however , there is a view that yoshinobu had no cho@@ ice -lsb- but to retreat -rsb- because at that time it was necessary to suppress military revol@@ ts in edo as well as in musashi province , and because yoshinobu became the imperial court ` s enemy , various clans were al@@ ien@@ ating themselves one after another from the shogunate ; thus , even if he was able to protect osaka-jo castle , a long-@@ term battle had to be avoided in order to prevent interv@@ ent@@ ions from foreign countries .
because he entered kan ` ei-ji temple for discipl@@ inary confin@@ ement as soon as the new government designated him as the imperial court ` s enemy , he was considered as a reas@@ on@@ able man who respected the emperor and the imperial court -lrb- per@@ h@@ aps this was due to the teaching of mit@@ o-@@ han -lsb- clan -rsb- that highly respected the emperor and also to the fact that his mother was from the imperial family -rrb- ; however , on the other hand , he was also called weak@@ -@@ k@@ need because as the lord of his people , he was not able to stand resol@@ ut@@ ely in the face of the enemy .
because of his compl@@ iance with the discipl@@ inary confin@@ ement and the blood@@ less transfer of edo-jo castle , the administrative power was transferred as a result of almost a blood@@ less revol@@ ution ; he contributed greatly to the restoration and ens@@ uring of independ@@ ency of modern japan .
busin@@ ess@@ man ei@@ ichi shi@@ bus@@ awa was a vassal appointed during -lsb- yoshinobu ` s -rsb- ten@@ ure as the head of the hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi tokugawa family , and they kept their contact even after the meiji restoration .
in yoshinobu ` s last years , shi@@ bus@@ awa aimed to ed@@ it yoshinobu ` s biography ; he persu@@ aded un@@ w@@ illing yoshinobu and started `` se@@ kim@@ ukai `` meetings to h@@ ear stories directly from yoshinobu .
a collection of these stories is called `` se@@ kim@@ ukai hik@@ ki `` .
in one of the chapters which was recorded in the form of a discussion , one can see what yoshinobu ` s voice , so to sp@@ eak , was like .
he used his age as an exc@@ use to ev@@ ade un@@ pal@@ at@@ able questions and he let out his true feelings by saying , `` i didn ` t really like hisam@@ itsu shimazu `` and `` naomasa nab@@ es@@ hima was a c@@ un@@ ning fel@@ low `` ; from these comm@@ ents , one can see his personality and what he was feeling at that time .
after yoshinobu ` s death `` tokugawa yoshin@@ o@@ bu-@@ ko den `` was completed based on these materials .
in order to show his grat@@ itude to emperor meiji who pardoned yoshinobu from being the enemy of the imperial court and gave him the title of ko@@ shaku , the highest rank of the peers , yoshinobu directed in his will that his funeral be conducted in the shinto style rather than the buddhist style .
therefore , yoshinobu ` s grave is neither in the tokugawa family graveyard of his family temple zo@@ jo-ji temple or the tokugawa family graveyard at kan ` ei-ji temple ; instead , a tumulus similar to that of the imperial family was built in yan@@ aka cemet@@ ery .
he did so because he was moved by the fact that emperor komei ` s tomb was very simple -lrb- `` tokugawa yoshin@@ o@@ bu-@@ ko den `` -rrb- .
after his par@@ don , yoshinobu enjoyed a rel@@ a@@ xed life without any reg@@ ards to his former vassals who devoted their lives to him ; on this , roju kat@@ suk@@ iyo it@@ akura later comm@@ ented , `` i reg@@ re@@ t working together with yoshinobu `` .
even though he has an image of being a sp@@ in@@ eless c@@ ow@@ ard , because he `` ran away in the face of his enemy `` during the battle of toba-@@ fushimi , there has recently been a foc@@ us on his attempt at constructing a new , modern political system after taisei hokan , and there is a movement to re-@@ evalu@@ ate his contribu@@ tions including air@@ ing of `` tokugawa yoshinobu `` -lrb- an nhk tai@@ ga drama -rrb- .
as with his father , nari@@ aki , he liked pork from sat@@ suma-@@ han clan and he was called bu@@ ta@@ ichi@@ -@@ sama -lrb- meaning hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi-@@ sama who lik@@ es pork -rrb- .
he was interested in items of western culture , and in his later years he liked to eat bre@@ ad and drink milk and he enjoyed his interests in photograp@@ hy , fishing , riding the bic@@ y@@ cle , m@@ ic@@ ro@@ s@@ copy and craft -lrb- em@@ bro@@ id@@ ery -rrb- . during his ten@@ ure as the shogun , he learned french from am@@ ane nishi but he gave up on this .
he was well know as a photograp@@ her , but his techniques in photograp@@ hy seemed to have been medi@@ ocr@@ e .
he often submitted his photograp@@ h@@ s to photograp@@ hy magaz@@ ines , but his photograp@@ h@@ s were hardly ever printed in the magaz@@ ines .
his great grandchild , yoshitomo tokugawa , is a fre@@ el@@ ance photograp@@ her ; he discovered photograp@@ h@@ s stored in the yoshinobu tokugawa family including the ones taken by yoshinobu and he published the pho@@ to al@@ bu@@ m after organ@@ izing and edit@@ ing them .
yoshinobu ` s biological younger brother , akit@@ ake tokugawa , was his friend who shared his ho@@ b@@ b@@ ies in his life .
he married mik@@ ako ichijo -lrb- name changed to mik@@ ako after the meiji restoration -rrb- on december 3 , 185@@ 5 .
the first daughter -lrb- kei@@ ko@@ in -rrb- between mik@@ a was born on july 16 , 1858 but she soon died on july 20 .
afterwards , there were no more children between mik@@ a ; the 10 boys and 11 girls born during the meiji era were children born between his two concub@@ ines .
some of these children include the seventh son , yoshihisa , who became a ko@@ shaku and succeeded to the yoshinobu tokugawa family , tenth son , ku@@ wa@@ shi , who married into kai@@ shu katsu ` s family and ninth daughter , tsune@@ ko , who became prince fushimi hiro@@ yasu .
some of yoshihisa ` s children include yoshimitsu tokugawa and princess kik@@ uko who married prince takamatsu nobu@@ hito .

notes
the jr nara line is a railway line -lrb- ar@@ ter@@ ial line -rrb- of the west japan railway company -lrb- jr west -rrb- that runs between kizu station -lrb- kyoto prefecture -rrb- in kiz@@ ugawa city , kyoto prefecture , and kyoto station in the shimogyo ward of kyoto city , kyoto prefecture .
the entire rai@@ l line is included in the section covering the metropolitan area and its sub@@ ur@@ bs .
although the nara line officially starts at kizu station because it is historically a branch line of the kansai main line , outbound trains -lrb- od@@ d-@@ numbered trains -rrb- run from kyoto to kizu and inbound trains -lrb- ev@@ en-@@ numbered trains -rrb- run in the opposite direction .
unless o@@ ther@@ wise specified , the descriptions are given according to the outbound direction from kyoto to kizu , except for in the track data section .
the line ` s own color is brown , which has been chosen to represent ` a classic , sop@@ hi@@ stic@@ ated im@@ pression suitable for conn@@ ections between two historic cities . `

all stations except kizu station are managed by the kyoto branch of the west japan railway company , while the kizu station is managed by the osaka branch of the west japan railway company .
the line between kyoto station and kizu station is called the nara line , but the entire line lies within kyoto prefecture , not in nara prefecture .
this is because , initially , the nara line was built by nara railways between kyoto station and nara station , but kizu station and other stations south of kizu station were separated from the nara line in order to be part of a route between osaka and nagoya after nara railways was merged into kansai railways .
however , trains run from kizu station to nara station in nara prefecture through the kansai main line -lrb- yamat@@ oji line -rrb- .
jr west established popular names -lrb- jr kyoto line , jr kobe line or the like -rrb- for the lines in the urban network with the revision of march 13 , 1988 , but a popular name was not given to the nara line .
the nara line is also referred to as the ` jr nara line ` in order to distinguish it from the kintetsu nara line of kintetsu corporation .
the nara line was referred to as the ` jnr nara line ` in the era of japan national railways -lrb- jnr -rrb- , the former jr , and the information board included the english no@@ tation ` jnr . `
the kintetsu nara line compet@@ es with the yamat@@ oji line between nan@@ ba and nara , whereas the jr nara line compet@@ es with the kintetsu kyoto line .
while many trains used to run on the keihan uji line and the kintetsu kyoto line -lrb- both of which run parallel to the nara line -rrb- , the nara line was only electrif@@ ied toward the end of jnr in 1984 ; consequently , it remained just a small local line on which the jnr / jr commuter train series 10@@ 5 -lrb- com@@ pris@@ ing two cars or the like -rrb- ran for some time , even after electrif@@ ication , until the privat@@ ization of the jnr .
however , after the foundation of jr west and the nara line ` s incorpor@@ ation into the urban network , the improvement of transportation services was quickly achieved with , for example , trains comprised of four cars -lrb- some comprised of six cars -rrb- , double-@@ tr@@ acked in part , or with increased numbers of trains , including rapid services such as the ` miyak@@ oji rapid service . `
today , the nara line is characterized by the access it off@@ ers to sightseeing areas such as b@@ yodo-@@ in temple in uji city , or by a commuter line for passengers from the southern part of the kyoto prefecture , such as jo@@ yo city .
however , trains go around toward the east between momoyama station and shinden station and run the edge of the central part of town in jo@@ yo or to the south of jo@@ yo ; thus the regional and transportation g@@ aps between the nara line and the kintetsu kyoto line remain .
rolling stock owned by the osaka branch for the nara rai@@ l y@@ ard is used , but station facilities are maintained by the kyoto branch -lrb- except for kizu station -rrb- .
the following commuter passes can be used at all stations on this line : j@@ -@@ thr@@ u / icoca ; suic@@ a , which is offered by the east japan railway company -lrb- jr east -rrb- ; to@@ ica , which is offered by the central japan railway company -lrb- jr central -rrb- ; and pitapa , which is offered by the sur@@ ut@@ to kansai association .
simple ticket gates are used at jo@@ yo station or stations to the south of jo@@ yo station , as some un@@ man@@ ned stations still exist .
after the limited express ` kuro@@ shi@@ o ` connecting kyoto station with wakayama station via the nara , sakurai and wakayama lines ceased operation in 1984 , only the local trains ran until 1991 -lrb- except for the temporary operation of a special limited express -rrb- , but now there are four types of trains : the miyak@@ oji rapid service , the rapid service , the trains classified by operation and section , and the local train .
the miyak@@ oji rapid service -- the f@@ ast@@ est train on the nara line -- runs mainly during the day .
the train basically runs every 30 minutes and vari@@ ously connects with the local trains at uji station .
the public gave this train the nickname ` miyak@@ oji rapid train ` before it went into operation .
not only japanese people but also foreign visitors use the miyak@@ oji rapid service as a train connecting kyoto with nara , both of which are sightseeing dest@@ inations .
the cars are all from the jr sub@@ urban train series 2@@ 21 , which com@@ pris@@ es either four or six cars .
the maxim@@ um train speed is 1@@ 10 km / h in double-@@ track sections , or 9@@ 5 km / h in other sections .
the standard travel times are approximately 44 minutes from kyoto to nara and about 47 minutes from nara to kyoto .
a train bound for kyoto stops at kam@@ ikoma station or tan@@ akura station for about two minutes and passes the miyak@@ oji rapid service bound for nara , thus making a sl@@ ight difference between the travel times of the inbound train and outbound train .
during the new year holiday the train temporarily stops at inari station for visitors to fushimi inari taisha shrine .
history
march 3 , 2001 : operations began .
march 15 , 2003 : the train began making stops at tofuku-ji station and tam@@ am@@ izu station through a revision of the schedu@@ le .
the rapid service runs during the morning and evening rush periods .
it stops at j@@ r@@ -@@ ogura station and shinden station -lrb- kyoto prefecture -rrb- , through which the ` miyak@@ oji rapid service ` passes .
the cars used are all from the jr sub@@ urban train series 2@@ 21 , which com@@ pris@@ es either four or six cars .
the train basically runs every 30 minutes and vari@@ ously connects with the local train at the uji station .
like the miyak@@ oji rapid service , the rapid service passes through nar@@ ayama station , at which the rapid train on the yamat@@ oji line stops .
before the ` miyak@@ oji rapid train ` came into operation in march 2001 , the rapid train had stopped at kyoto , uji , jo@@ yo -lrb- except at the beginning -rrb- , kizu and nara stations , empl@@ o@@ ying the jnr / jr sub@@ urban train series 1@@ 17 for its cars ; since then , however , this series has not been used on the nara line .
some rapid service trains run through to the yamat@@ oji line in the morning and evening due to the schedu@@ le of operation .
the regional rapid service runs mainly in the morning and n@@ ight@@ time hours .
initially , the operation was limited to week@@ days , but with the schedu@@ le revision of march 18 , 2006 it was changed to satur@@ days and holidays in addition to week@@ days .
the regional rapid service stops at every station between uji station and nara station , while some regional rapid services bound for kizu used to pass the local train at uji station in the late evening , etc . , due to the schedu@@ le ; however , based on the current schedu@@ le , the regional rapid service doesn ` t pass the local train before reaching the arrival station .
all regional rapid services empl@@ o@@ y the jr sub@@ urban train series 2@@ 21 , except that one regional rapid service leaving kyoto station between 8 p@@ .@@ m. and 9 p@@ .@@ m. on satur@@ days and holidays empl@@ o@@ ys the jnr / jr commuter train series 10@@ 3 .
due to the operation schedu@@ le , some regional rapid services run through from the yamat@@ oji line during the morning rush period .
the regional rapid service on the nara line formerly used or@@ an@@ ge letters as the line ` s own color , but it was the same color as the one used for the ` miyak@@ oji rapid service ` and the rapid service so as to distinguish the regional rapid service on the nara line from that of the yamat@@ oji line . however , in march 2008 , with the re@@ plac@@ ement of signs along with the revision of the schedu@@ le , a sign for the regional rapid service was changed to include green letters , whereby the use of the line color was stopped .
at the kam@@ ikoma station or stations to the north of kam@@ ikoma station , purple letters are used on the timetable boards .
the local train runs between kyoto station , uji station , jo@@ yo station and nara station .
the train runs every 15 minutes during the day between kyoto station and jo@@ yo station , and every 30 minutes between jo@@ yo station and kizu station .
basically , the cars are from the jnr / jr commuter train series 10@@ 3 , but some are from the jr sub@@ urban train series 2@@ 21 .
due to the schedu@@ le , some local trains go through to the yamat@@ oji line in the early morning and late evening .
formerly , some local trains would go through to the sakurai line , but with the schedu@@ le revision of september 4 , 1994 , the nara and sakurai lines were divided .
formerly , a limited express ran on the nara line as a special train .
a limited express which had the nickname ` kuro@@ shi@@ o xx ` from 1987 to 1988 and ` kuro@@ shi@@ o xx ` from 1988 to 1989 , the jnr / jr limited express series 3@@ 8@@ 1@@ ran between kyoto station and shir@@ a@@ hama station via the kansai main line , the kansai main line han@@ wa freight line and the han@@ wa line .
the kinki edition of the yom@@ i@@ uri shinbun newspaper announced on january 6 , 1998 that a limited express com@@ pris@@ ing the jnr / jr limited express series 3@@ 81 would beg@@ in operating -lrb- as a regular train -rrb- on the nara line in about 2001 , but eventually the plan was canc@@ eled .
the miyak@@ oji le@@ is@@ ure train ran between kyoto station and sakurai station -lrb- the miyak@@ oji rapid service ran for the section between kyoto station and nara station -rrb- for some time , but now there is no train excluding a special train going through to the sakurai line .
the uji@@ -gawa river fire@@ works display -lrb- near@@ est stop : uji station -rrb- is held in mid-@@ august , when the special schedu@@ le is introduced to secure sufficient transport capacity before 4 p@@ .@@ m. to the end ; after 4 p@@ .@@ m. , only the local trains run between kyoto station and uji station at interv@@ als of approximately 10 minutes .
kizu station is the arrival and departure station of some local trains .
when the nara line was a single track , a special schedu@@ le was adopted during the new year holidays , according to which the rapid train stopped at every station between kyoto station and uji station , and the number of trains traveling to uji station was increased .
during some new year holidays the train would arrive at and de@@ part from momoyama station .
in about 1992 -lrb- mainly on satur@@ days and holidays -rrb- a through train to the sakurai line bound for tenri station ran once an hour by extending its regular rapid service .
occasionally , trains re@@ served for groups enter the nara line from around the country .
during the ten@@ ri@@ kyo autumn grand service held every october 26 , particularly , the through train den@@ oted as a ` train re@@ served for groups : ten@@ ri@@ kyo transportation train ` runs from kyoto station to kizu station via the nara line , to nara station via the yamat@@ oji line , and to tenri station via the sakurai line .
all cars belong to the nara rai@@ l y@@ ard .
jr sub@@ urban train series 2@@ 21
the nara line shar@@ es the jr sub@@ urban train series 2@@ 21 -lrb- com@@ pris@@ ing two , four or six cars -rrb- with the yamat@@ oji line , the osaka lo@@ op line , etc .
the jr sub@@ urban train series 2@@ 21 com@@ pris@@ ing either four or six cars is used mainly for the ` miyak@@ oji rapid service ` and the ` rapid service , ` while the one com@@ pris@@ ing four cars mainly enters the nara line .
the jr sub@@ urban train series 2@@ 21 -lrb- com@@ pris@@ ing two cars joining two other cars -rrb- runs according to the holiday schedu@@ le .
jnr / jr commuter train series 10@@ 3
the jnr / jr commuter train series 10@@ 3 -lrb- com@@ pris@@ ing four cars -rrb- is used on the nara line for the local train , while the one com@@ pris@@ ing eight cars -lrb- four joining four other cars -rrb- is used on the osaka lo@@ op line and on the yamat@@ oji line for the regional rapid service during the rush hours .
part of the rolling stock is replaced with stock transferred from the osaka lo@@ op line ` s mor@@ in@@ omiya rai@@ l y@@ ard .
the line connecting kyoto , kizu and nara was opened by the nara electric railway , and initially trains ran the same route as the current kintetsu kyoto line between kyoto and momoyama .
in 1921 , the tokaido main line between b@@ aba -lrb- currently ze@@ ze -rrb- station and kyoto station was swit@@ ched to the current line via the higashiyama tunnel ; and on the same day the old tokaido main line between kyoto station and inari station and a new line between inari station and momoyama station came to serve as the nara line , whereby the line between kyoto station and fushimi station was abolished and the line between fushimi station and momoyama station was made a freight line .

the kei@@ ji by@@ pass is the by@@ pass of a national highway that ext@@ ends from kus@@ atsu city in shiga prefecture to kum@@ iyama town , kus@@ e-@@ gun in kyoto prefecture .
it is a planning route designated as a local high-@@ standard highway .
the first description below refers to a t@@ ol@@ l road called the kei@@ ji by@@ pass and the second refers to a by@@ pass joining national high@@ ways 1 and 24 that is also called the kei@@ ji by@@ pass .
its t@@ ol@@ l road section is integrated in the me@@ ishin expressway to conn@@ ect the rit@@ to interchange -lrb- in the direction of nagoya city -rrb- and the su@@ ita interchange -lrb- in the direction of osaka city -rrb- of the me@@ ishin expressway by passing round the urban areas of otsu city and kyoto city .
in terms of laws , the section from the set@@ a-@@ higashi interchange to the kumi@@ yama@@ yodo interchange , being part of the national high@@ ways 1 and 4@@ 78 , is a regional high-@@ standard road ; the kumi@@ yama@@ yodo interchange to o@@ yamazaki junc@@ tion , a part of national highway 4@@ 78 , is a high-@@ standard highway designated by the ministry of land , in@@ fr@@ a@@ structure and transportation -lrb- a national highway only for vehi@@ cles -rrb- -lrb- kyoto-@@ dain@@ i-@@ so@@ to-@@ kan@@ jo-@@ d@@ oro belt line of the kyoto ju@@ kan-@@ jid@@ ou@@ sh@@ do expressway -rrb- ; and the section from o@@ yamazaki junc@@ tion to kumi@@ yam@@ yodo interchange is a national express highway -lrb- a section called the kei@@ ji by@@ pass of the chuo jid@@ o@@ sha-@@ do national expressway -rrb- .
to re@@ duce con@@ gest@@ ion on the me@@ ishin expressway and respond to the need for a road network that could serve as a rad@@ ial road and belt line in kyoto city , the construction of the kyoto-@@ dain@@ i-@@ so@@ to-@@ kan@@ jo-@@ d@@ oro belt line was subsequently planned to conn@@ ect the kyoto-@@ tanb@@ a-@@ d@@ oro -lrb- formerly the by@@ pass of national highway 9 -rrb- to the kei@@ ji by@@ pass .
the kyoto ju@@ kan-@@ jid@@ o@@ sh@@ ado expressway and the kyoto-@@ dain@@ i-@@ so@@ to-@@ kan@@ jo-@@ d@@ oro belt line were designated as national highway 4@@ 78 , and their construction has been continuously promoted .

the uji tunnel of this section is , at 4@@ ,@@ 3@@ 13 meters , the long@@ est on the national highway ; l@@ ane changes are prohibited in the tunnel except between the area 500 meters short of the kas@@ at@@ ori interchange and the uji@@ higashi interchange .
a well-known japanese movie called `` od@@ oru dai@@ sos@@ as@@ en the movie 2 : block up the rain@@ bow bridge `` was fil@@ med around the kum@@ iyama junc@@ tion before it was opened .
because less distance is traveled between the set@@ a-@@ higashi junc@@ tion and the o@@ yamazaki interchange / junc@@ tion if driv@@ ers take the kei@@ ji by@@ pass instead of the me@@ ishin highway , a driv@@ er dr@@ iving at the speed lim@@ it on the kei@@ ji by@@ pass will arrive at their dest@@ ination more quickly than a driv@@ er dr@@ iving at the speed lim@@ it on the me@@ ishin highway .
the kei@@ ji by@@ pass has no rest service areas or other such facilities , so it ` s less con@@ g@@ ested than the me@@ ishin expressway -lrb- which has two rest areas : otsu rest area and katsur@@ agawa rest area between set@@ a@@ higashi and o@@ yamazaki . -rrb-
however , due to the design of both the set@@ o-@@ higashi@@ a and o@@ yamazaki junc@@ tions , which requ@@ ire ram@@ ps -lrb- in the highway lan@@ es -rrb- to conn@@ ect them to the me@@ ishin highway -lrb- in particular the very complicated design of the o@@ yamazaki junc@@ tion -rrb- , driv@@ ers have to re@@ duce their speed .
another dis@@ advantage is that driv@@ ers often en@@ counter con@@ gest@@ ion as they attempt to mer@@ ge into the left l@@ ane of the me@@ ishin highway from the o@@ yamazaki junc@@ tion toward su@@ ita or osaka .
moreover , many driv@@ ers dis@@ like the win@@ ding areas and sl@@ op@@ es along the kei@@ ji by@@ pass , so the kei@@ ji by@@ pass doesn ` t fully perform its function as a by@@ pass .
furthermore , it ` s a by@@ pass of national highway 1 -lrb- a general national highway -rrb- , which means it isn ` t a expressway but a mo@@ tor highway .
when driv@@ ers want to get on the kei@@ ji by@@ pass toward su@@ ita or osaka from the east side of the uji@@ -gawa river -lrb- near the uji@@ higashi interchange -rrb- , they must go to the ujin@@ ishi interchange .
this is because the uji@@ higashi interchange is a half-@@ interchange .
as a result , local roads lin@@ king the uji@@ higashi and ujin@@ ishi inter@@ changes are commonly con@@ g@@ ested during the rush hours .
this area is outside the v@@ ics -lrb- vehicle information and communication system -rrb- lin@@ k z@@ one , which makes it difficult for driv@@ ers to use their con@@ gest@@ ion-@@ avo@@ id@@ ance sch@@ em@@ es .

higashi hongan-ji temple is a shin buddhist temple in shimogyo ward , kyoto city , kyoto .
it is the head temple of the otani sect , which is part of the shinshu kyo@@ dan ren@@ go -lrb- ten schools of shin buddhism -rrb- , and also jo@@ ins nishi hongan-ji temple -lrb- officially hongan-ji temple , head temple of the hongan-ji sect of shin buddhism -rrb- , as one of the main temples of shin buddhism .
the official name of the temple was `` hongan-ji `` until 1987 , since which time it has been `` shinshu hon@@ b@@ yo temple `` .
to distinguish it from nishi hongan-ji temple , also in shimogyo ward , it is often called `` o-@@ higashi-@@ san `` .
-lrb- for history before the east-@@ west split , refer to the article on the history of hongan-ji temple . -rrb-
kyo@@ un@@ yo -lrb- k@@ ou@@ ju -rrb- , the 12th master of hongan-ji temple , was given a domain for a temple to the east of hongan-ji by ieyasu tokugawa , and founded higashi hongan-ji temple when hongan-ji temple split in 160@@ 2 .
located in present day karasuma shichijo , shimogyo ward , kyoto , it is called higashi temple -lrb- eastern -rrb- hongan-ji temple because it is to the east of nishi -lrb- western -rrb- hongan-ji temple , which is located at horikawa shichijo .
it was a religious corporation over@@ seen by the otani sect until 1987 , at which time hongan-ji temple was leg@@ ally dissolved and absorbed by the sect .
after that , higashi hongan-ji temple ` s official name became `` shinshu hon@@ b@@ yo temple `` -lrb- `` hon@@ b@@ yo `` means the original sanctuary where followers h@@ ear the teaching of the patri@@ arch shinran , the rest@@ ing place of shinran -rrb- .
it is also to distinguish it from the break@@ away higashi hongan-ji sect of shin buddhism and emphas@@ ize its pro@@ pri@@ ety .

amaterasu omikami -lrb- tensho daijin -rrb- is a hum@@ an@@ ized shinto god in japanese .
in `` engishiki -lrb- list of official shrines -rrb- , `` `` amaterasu `` of amaterasu omikami is c@@ ited as `` amat@@ eru `` when worshipped as the god of nature .
amaterasu omikami is the god of the sun and one of the oy@@ agami -lrb- parent deities -rrb- of the imperial family -lrb- the kos@@ oshin -lrb- imperial ancestor -rrb- -rrb- .
in `` kojiki -lrb- records of ancient matters -rrb- , `` amaterasu omikami is referred to as 天@@ 照@@ 大@@ 御@@ 神 whereas in `` nihonshoki -lrb- chronicles of japan -rrb- `` the god is c@@ ited as 天@@ 照@@ 大@@ 神 .
another name given to her is o@@ hir@@ um@@ enom@@ uchi no kami .
in `` nihonshoki -lrb- chronicles of japan -rrb- , `` amaterasu omikami is referred to under different names , whereas in `` kojiki -lrb- records of ancient matters -rrb- `` she is consist@@ ently c@@ ited as `` 天@@ 照@@ 大@@ 御@@ 神 . ``
amaterasu omikami is considered to be female , but some say the god is male .
because the name of amaterasu omikami was used in the political scene as shown in `` ko@@ tai jingu g@@ ishi@@ ki@@ sho , `` sho@@ ei mishima and tsu@@ tom@@ u sai@@ jo even arg@@ ue that takam@@ im@@ usubi was the kos@@ oshin -lrb- imperial ancestor -rrb- ; , and that hir@@ ume was d@@ ei@@ fied and became amaterasu omikami .
at ise jingu shrine , amaterasu omikami is typ@@ ically referred to as amaterasu sume omikami , sume omikami or amater@@ as@@ im@@ asu sume omikami , particularly when the name is ut@@ tered before the altar in ceremonies .
in academic documents she is now custom@@ arily sp@@ elled `` ア@@ マ@@ テ@@ ラ@@ ス `` in kat@@ ak@@ ana .
some say that in old days she was c@@ ited as 天@@ 照@@ 太@@ 神 .
how amaterasu omikami is described in my@@ ths
according to `` kojiki -lrb- records of ancient matters -rrb- , `` amaterasu omikami was born from izanagi as she rin@@ sed her left eye when saf@@ ely returning from yomi -lrb- the world after death -rrb- where izanami lived , in order to remove the d@@ ir@@ t .
at this time , tsuku@@ yomi was born from her right eye and susanoo from her nose , and the three together have come to be called mi@@ hashi@@ ra no u@@ z@@ uno miko -lrb- three noble children -rrb- .
izanagi then instruc@@ ted amaterasu omikami to rule takam@@ ano@@ hara .
because susanoo — who had been instruc@@ ted to rule un@@ abara -lrb- the sea -rrb- — kept c@@ rying , saying he wanted to go to the land of the roots -lrb- the land of izanami -rrb- , he was finally expelled by izanagi .
although susan@@ ao ascended to takam@@ ano@@ hara to meet amaterasu omikami , his elder sister , on the way to the land of the roots , amaterasu omikami , who assumed her brother was coming to depr@@ ive her of takam@@ ano@@ hara , armed herself and wa@@ ited for him .
after susanoo made a pl@@ edge to prov@@ e that he had no such intention , five male gods were born from amaterasu omikami ` s mon@@ o@@ zane -lrb- the media from which gods are given birth -rrb- and three female gods from that of susanoo , and susanoo declared victory .
the following are the five gods considered to be born from amaterasu omikami ` s mon@@ o@@ zane and are therefore her children :
ameno@@ oshi@@ hom@@ imi
ameno@@ ho@@ hi
am@@ atsu@@ hikone
ik@@ utsu@@ hikone
kum@@ an@@ oku@@ subi
susanoo , swe@@ pt up by the event , became wild and viol@@ ent at takam@@ ano@@ hara , causing his sister to hide herself in ama no iwat@@ o -lrb- the cave of heaven -rrb- .
this threw the entire world into dar@@ kn@@ ess , and various problems occurred .
ya@@ o yor@@ ozu no kami@@ -like chichi@@ bu no kami -lrb- the god of wisdom -rrb- , am@@ eno yag@@ ok@@ or@@ o@@ om@@ oik@@ ane no mikoto and am@@ eno ko@@ y@@ ane no mik@@ oto@@ -@@ eventually became successful in getting her out of ama no iwat@@ o , but she dro@@ ve him out of takam@@ ano@@ hara .
amaterasu omikami — who had decided that she would have one of her sons , ameno@@ oshi@@ hom@@ imi , desc@@ end to ashi@@ hara no nakatsuk@@ uni — dispatched amatsu kami -lrb- the god of heaven -rrb- there .
by the time ameno@@ oshi@@ hom@@ imi was ready to desc@@ end to ashi@@ hara no nakatsuk@@ uni , where peace and order had been established , nin@@ igi — the grandchild of amaterasu omikami — was born and ordered to go down there by amaterasu omikami .
interpre@@ t@@ ations
because some my@@ ths say that amaterasu omikami sought opinions from her elder amatsu kami -lrb- the god of heaven -rrb- about her specific act@@ s-@@ whether they were good or not@@ -@@ and even followed his instructions , some consider that amaterasu omikami was a d@@ ei@@ fied emperor who ruled the country by conduc@@ ting religious services .
others have viewed her as a d@@ ei@@ fied miko -lrb- female shinto attendant -rrb- .
her ali@@ as name , `` hir@@ ume , `` literally means `` the woman of the sun , `` as a miko , an attendant of the sun god .
according to a theory , a miko who had served the god of the sun came to be regarded as ident@@ ical to the god himself ; this caused the god to be thought of as female , although the god of the sun is typ@@ ically male .
other theories consider that amaterasu omikami is female because her my@@ th was established during the era of empress jito , or because himiko was her model .
the idea that the god of the sun -lrb- amaterasu omikami -rrb- and the god of the moon -lrb- tsuku@@ yomi -rrb- were born from the eyes of izanagi shows a strong influence of tao@@ ism , whose can@@ ons `` rei@@ ho go@@ bu@@ jo `` -lrb- completed by the sixth century -rrb- and `` go@@ ho in@@ nen@@ kyo `` -lrb- written at the beginning of the seventh century -rrb- respectively contain descriptions of `` turning his eyes into the sun and the moon `` and `` turning his left eye into the sun and his right eye into the moon . ``
some say there is a par@@ all@@ el@@ ism between shinto and tao@@ ism in some of the terms used for ise jingu shrine , which wor@@ ships amaterasu omikami — such as okami -lrb- great god -rrb- , jingu , it@@ suki no miya , it@@ suki no yak@@ ata , murasaki no miz@@ o , kiyo@@ gin@@ u , mit@@ eg@@ ura and u@@ suk@@ inu — and in the idea behind div@@ iding its shrine into ko@@ tai jingu and to@@ you@@ ke dai@@ jingu .
in compar@@ ative mythology , the my@@ th of the birth of amaterasu omikami is nearly ident@@ ical to that of pan@@ gu , as recorded earlier -lrb- some@@ where during the third or fourth century -rrb- .
because the story of turning the eyes into the sun and the moon is a common an@@ alog@@ y found across asia , some consider that the my@@ th was propag@@ ated as pe@@ o@@ ples mig@@ rated around the region during pre@@ history .
some scholars point out that in `` nihon shoki `` -lrb- chronicles of japan -rrb- , the div@@ inity of amaterasu omikami , was changed in three stages .
the following describes the historical events and their details that triggered the changes :
6@@ 45 : the taika era reforms took place .
it was after these reforms that the imperial family began to worship amaterasu omikami .
hi no kami -lrb- the god of the sun -rrb- or the sun itself .
a male god called `` amat@@ eru `` was widely worshipped .
`` engishiki -lrb- list of official shrines -rrb- `` l@@ ists the shrines that contained within their names the word `` amat@@ eru `` — like the amat@@ eru jinja shrine of tsushima , the i@@ ib@@ on@@ i@@ amat@@ eru jinja shrine of harima and the amat@@ eru mit@@ ama no mikoto jinja shrine of tanba .
in fact , amat@@ eru -lrb- as the name of the male god -rrb- is the ali@@ as name of amaterasu omikami ` s grandson ameno@@ ho@@ akari , who is the first ancestor of the owari , tsum@@ ori and kai@@ fu clans .
additionally , ameno@@ ho@@ akari ` s younger brother was nin@@ igi , the great-@@ grandfather of emperor jim@@ mu .
672 : the jin@@ s@@ in war broke out .
`` o@@ hir@@ um@@ enom@@ uchi -lrb- a woman who wor@@ ships the god of the sun -rrb- `` or `` tanab@@ at@@ atsume . ``
two interpre@@ t@@ ations exist : first , to consider that the god worshipped was o@@ hir@@ um@@ enom@@ uchi -lrb- a female god -rrb- , and secon@@ dly , to think that the god honored was amat@@ eru , the male god in the form of a sn@@ ake .
69@@ 8 : ko@@ dai jingu was elected .
`` amater@@ as , `` or the ancestor god of the imperial family
a female god .
using empress jito as a model , amaterasu omikami was changed from the god of nature into a hum@@ an@@ ized god .
since then , the `` amaterasu `` portion of amaterasu omikami , if not meant to be the kos@@ oshin -lrb- the ancestor of the imperial family -rrb- , has been pronounced `` amat@@ eru . ``
for example , in `` sar@@ ashina nikki -lrb- sar@@ ashina diary -rrb- , `` written around 10@@ 60 , the amaterasu omikami was c@@ ited as `` 天@@ 照@@ 御@@ 神 `` and the portion of `` 天@@ 照 `` was pronounced `` amat@@ eru , `` while in `` sendai ku@@ ji@@ hon@@ gi , `` `` 天@@ 照@@ 孁 `` is provided with the fur@@ ig@@ ana read@@ ings `` ア@@ マ@@ テ@@ ル@@ ヒ@@ ル@@ メ@@ ノ@@ ム@@ チ `` -lrb- `` amat@@ eru hir@@ um@@ enom@@ uchi `` -rrb- .
from 1880 to 1881 , a fierce debate took place over the shinto doctrine concerning which gods should be enshrined in the temple of shinto jim@@ uk@@ yoku -lrb- office -rrb- in hib@@ iya , tokyo .
shi@@ to jim@@ uk@@ yoku , which had decided to enshrine in its temple four gods and zok@@ as@@ an@@ shin -lrb- the three gods of creation -rrb- -@@ am@@ eno min@@ ak@@ an@@ ushi no kami , takam@@ im@@ usubi no kami and kam@@ im@@ usubi no kami-@@ and amaterasu omikami met with opposition from the izumo group , which st@@ ressed the idea of yuk@@ en ichin@@ yo -lrb- the un@@ ity of this world and the world after death -rrb- and insisted on worshi@@ pping five gods , including okuni n@@ ushi no okami , the ruling god of yukai -lrb- the world after death -rrb- .
however , the ise group , which had played the central role in shi@@ to jim@@ uk@@ yoku , argued that amaterasu omikami was the great god of heaven and earth , which ruled ken@@ rei -lrb- this world and the world after death -rrb- and that other gods were simply her subordin@@ ates , thus creating a full-@@ scale confrontation between the two .
this confrontation es@@ cal@@ ated to the point where various rum@@ ors circulated that the izumo group might be trying to set@@ tle a deep-@@ seated gr@@ ud@@ ge against the ise group , which had accumul@@ ated since the era of gods , and that takat@@ omi sen@@ ge , who had been dis@@ loyal to the imperial family , had to be killed as punishment .
this debate was eventually brought to an end by the decision of emperor meiji , resulting in the defeat of the izumo group , and amaterasu omikami was ranked at the highest level of all the gods .
the government is said to have learned from this debate that it was impossible to establish a common shinto doctrine and to rule the people of the modern state directly through its restoration .
for more information , see `` debate regarding the gods to be enshrined , `` by shinto jim@@ uk@@ yoku , kok@@ ka shinto -lrb- state shinto -rrb- .
in depicting amaterasu omikami in his novel , ry@@ unosuke ak@@ utagawa used the ali@@ as `` o@@ hir@@ um@@ em@@ uchi . ``
this is because he wanted to dep@@ ict amaterasu omikami as the god of the sun or nature , not the kos@@ oshin -lrb- imperial ancestor -rrb- associated with the name `` amaterasu omikami . ``
in fact , ak@@ utagawa had to make many revis@@ ions , add@@ itions and del@@ et@@ ions to his novels due to the inspection conducted by the army .
masahiro yasu@@ oka -lrb- 189@@ 8-@@ 198@@ 3 -rrb- , the founder of kin@@ kei gaku@@ in -lrb- 1926 -rrb- , said that the japanese people worshipped amaterasu omikami .
amaterasu omikami represents the ide@@ al of the japanese spirit to cover the world with the r@@ ays of the sun .
the `` iz@@ ana `` of `` izanami `` and `` izanagi , `` which means `` to lead , `` also represents an ide@@ al of the japanese people who set an example for other pe@@ o@@ ples in the world as leaders , for@@ er@@ un@@ ners and origin@@ ators .
shrines that honor amaterasu omikami
shrines that worship amaterasu omikami are called shin@@ mei shrines and are scattered across the country , but their chief shrine is the nai@@ ku -lrb- inner shrine -rrb- of ise jingu shrine .
ko@@ tai jingu is a shrine that houses yat@@ aka no kagami -lrb- mirror of yat@@ aka -rrb- , one of the san@@ shu no jingi -lrb- three kinds of treasures -rrb- , as the object of worship .
nearly all the shrines in japan dist@@ ribu@@ te the shin@@ satsu -lrb- tal@@ is@@ man -rrb- -lrb- jingu tai@@ ma -lrb- shrine am@@ ul@@ et -rrb- -rrb- of ko@@ tai jingu shrine -lrb- ten@@ s@@ yo ko@@ tai jingu shrine -rrb- .
daimyo is an expression that came from daimyo@@ shu .
it sign@@ if@@ ies a person whose name is very famous .
as opposed to a shom@@ yo .
it originally meant a person who wi@@ elds influence in a region .
later , in samurai society , it came to mean a warrior who has a lot of territory or subordin@@ ates .
in the muromachi period the shugo strengthened their control over their assigned territories and became shugo daimyo .
in the warring states period , tai@@ shin ryo@@ shu -lrb- noble land owners -rrb- appeared who established even str@@ on@@ ger control over their territories , and were called daimyo@@ bun no kokujin or sengoku daimyo .
in the edo period the word specified a lord who was granted a territory of 10,000 koku or more from the edo shogunate .
among warriors with less than 10,000 koku , those who belonged to the shogunate were called jik@@ is@@ an .
in fact , because the feudal lords that were the daimyo shared characteristics with chinese lords -lrb- shoko -rrb- , they were also called daimyo shoko .
this section describes the details of the edo period , recent daimyo .
for shugo daimyo or sengoku daimyo , refer to the rel@@ ev@@ ant articles .
edo period daimyo
the rank of edo period daimyo was determined by family status , official rank , size of stipend , office , and service .
first , depending on his connection to the tokugawa shogun family , related families -lrb- shin@@ pan , shin@@ pan daimyo -rrb- were classified mainly as fudai daimyo -lrb- hereditary daimyo -rrb- that were vassals of the tokugawa family before the battle of sekigahara , and to@@ zama daimyo -lrb- non-@@ hereditary daimyo -rrb- that became vassals around the time of the battle of sekigahara .
the first shogun , ieyasu , in order to maintain the blood@@ line in the event that the shogun household died out , for supervis@@ ion and control of the daimyo nationwide , and for support of the shogunate , established three branch households of the tokugawa family that were allowed to use the tokugawa name , and sent the ninth son , yoshin@@ ao tokugawa , to the owari domain , the 10th son yor@@ inobu tokugawa to the kishu domain , and the 11th son yor@@ ifusa tokugawa to the mito domain .
beginning with the elder brother of the second shogun , hidetada tokugawa , and second son of ieyasu , hide@@ yasu yuki , was sent to the echizen domain , he placed tokugawa family members as daimyo all of the country .
moreover , over the generations the hereditary vassals that supported the beginning of the tokugawa shogun family were placed as fudai daimyo , who sec@@ ured the shogunate ` s military power while serving as important officials from the shogunate ` s chief minister to members of the council of elders , supported the shogunate ` s government .
the fudai daimyo had relatively small stip@@ ends , and aside from the prominent fudai hit@@ to in the ii clan who received an unusual 3@@ 5@@ 0,000 koku in the hikone domain , the torii , sak@@ ak@@ ib@@ ara , honda and ogasawara clans received relatively large stip@@ ends , but throughout the edo period only a few fudai daimyo maintained more than 100@@ .@@ 000 koku , starting with the sakai , abe , hot@@ ta , yanag@@ is@@ awa , and toda clans .
this was for the separation of influence and military power .
the to@@ zama daimyo were the daimyo that joined after the battle of sekigahara , and many had opposed the tokugawa at sekigahara .
the shogunate was very care@@ ful about that , actively carried out intell@@ ig@@ ence gathering activities using sp@@ ies , and when they f@@ eared im@@ pro@@ pri@@ ety or in@@ sur@@ rec@@ tion , did not h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to rev@@ oke rank .
representative of the to@@ zama daimyo were the kaga domain of the maeda clan , famous for the million koku of kaga , the satsuma domain of the shimazu clan , a family famous from the kamakura period , the sendai domain of the date clan , the fukuoka domain of the kuroda clan , the hiroshima domain of the asano clan , the choshu domain of the mori clan , the yon@@ e@@ zawa domain of the uesugi clan , the saga domain of the nab@@ es@@ hima clan , the kumamoto domain of the hosokawa clan , the okayama and tottori domains of the ikeda clan , the tokushima domain of the hachi@@ suka clan , the tosa domain of the tosa yamauchi clan , and the akita domain of the satake clan .
the status of a daimyo was defined as koku@@ shu if their territory was one province or more , or an equivalent number of koku , as joshu daimyo -lrb- joshu class -rrb- if they had a castle , those without a castle were distinguished as jinya , and the rooms that they occupied at edo castle during their service there were differ@@ enti@@ ated based on the daimyo ` s status .

daimyo , as a rule , had 10,000 koku or more , but the kit@@ su@@ reg@@ awa clan ` s kit@@ su@@ reg@@ awa domain was 5,000 koku .
that was because the kit@@ su@@ reg@@ awa clan were descendants of the ashikaga clan .
daimyo were subject to control by the shogunate through the laws for the military houses and the san@@ kin ko@@ tai -lrb- alternate attend@@ ance -rrb- system .
other than that , there was a system of ass@@ ign@@ ments called ot@@ etsu@@ dai , and at the end of the edo period some were ordered to def@@ end the coast , so the daimyo were always in a difficult position fin@@ anci@@ ally .
