rinzai zen buddhism is one of the chinese five houses / seven schools of zen -lrb- rinzai , ig@@ you , soto , un@@ mon , hog@@ an -rrb- and g@@ igen rinzai -lrb- ? - 8@@ 67 -rrb- of tang was its founder .
he was known as `` rinzai of kat@@ u -lrb- meaning to help wake up the sle@@ ep@@ ing mind -rrb- `` and `` general rinzai `` , and rose to the top of chinese zen with his distinc@@ tive style .
with its zen tal@@ ks that try to aw@@ ak@@ en self awar@@ eness through study of koan , it differs from the sil@@ ent zen of the soto sect , which just does meditation .
rinzai school in china
as the name impl@@ ies , rinzai school started with its founder g@@ igen rinzai at the end of the tang dynasty , after the anti-@@ buddhist movement at the kai@@ sho@@ u era .
rinzai was the disciple of ki@@ un obaku ; the school grew as a religious movement centered in the province of he@@ bei , with the support of chan@@ g@@ shi wang of the han@@ chin government , but in the confusion that arose around the end of the tang dynasty , he@@ bei was at the center of the t@@ um@@ ult@@ u@@ ous five dynasties and it became difficult to su@@ st@@ ain a religious movement .
the central figure around that time was en@@ sho@@ u fuk@@ etsu .
it was in the northern song dynasty that rinzai school became vi@@ bran@@ t again , below the gates of sek@@ iso so@@ en , along with en@@ an o@@ ur@@ yu and hou@@ e y@@ oug@@ i who came from ji@@ ang@@ xi province and created the two main s@@ ect@@ es of rinzai -lrb- o@@ ur@@ yu and y@@ oug@@ i -rrb- , and swe@@ pt across all of china .
when it came to the southern song dynasty , sou@@ ko@@ u dai@@ e , a disciple of kokug@@ on en@@ go who belonged to the y@@ oug@@ i sect , started the daikan sect in z@@ he@@ ji@@ ang province , which became a major sect in the rinzai school .
rinzai school in japan
according to doctrine , it was brought over to china from india by bod@@ hi@@ dharma , the 2@@ 8th successor of the 10 disciples -lrb- called ka@@ sho -rrb- who directly received the teaching -lrb- enlightenment -rrb- of sid@@ d@@ har@@ th@@ a g@@ aut@@ ama .
later the rinzai school , which achieved the p@@ in@@ n@@ acle of zen teaching , was brought to japan in the kamakura period by e@@ isai , who went to china to study in the southern song period .
japan ` s rinzai is one of zen schools in japan .
it emphas@@ izes the trans@@ mission of enlightenment from teacher to disciple . -lrb- has@@ su is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master . -rrb-
it cal@@ ls sak@@ yamuni the original teacher ven@@ er@@ able sak@@ yamuni buddha , bod@@ hi@@ dharma the first ancestor and great teacher bod@@ hi@@ dharma , and rinzai the founder and great teacher rinzai .
in contrast to the soto zen school which spre@@ ads through regional clans and the general people , the rinzai school received support from samurai families in government , and was est@@ e@@ emed in the politics and culture .
later , the rinzai school was rebuilt in the edo period by master haku@@ in , and continued to be called haku@@ in zen .
traditions
trans@@ mission of enlightenment from masters to disciples continues down to the present day -lrb- has@@ su is the disciple who inherited the teaching of the master -rrb- .
the important inter@@ action between the master and disciple is called `` a secret in the room `` and is not to be taken out of the master ` s room and revealed public@@ ly .
what is ex@@ tracted from the inter@@ actions between a master and disciple , or zen lecture transcrip@@ ts that record the actions of a master , is called a koan -lrb- preced@@ ent -rrb- and various collections have been compiled since the song dynasty ; but enlightenment is not something that can be commun@@ icated with words , so when people today try to understand the text , the koan itself ref@@ uses them .
however , they contain hin@@ ts that lead people toward enlightenment , and there are a great many zen books from the beginning down to the present day .
also since the song dynasty , the zen schools changed to a kann@@ az@@ en style in which masters give lectures using transcrip@@ ts of zen tal@@ ks and the masters became not to display the same maj@@ est@@ y as those in the tang dynasty including rinzai .
although masters cho@@ ose their success@@ ors when they die , the success@@ ors have not necessarily attained enlightenment by that time , but that fact is only known to the master and the successor himself .
even if the new master had not attained enlightenment , the disciples would have been able to do so if it is within a few generations from that of the master who gained enlightenment , therefore it is possible to take such a measure .
it is possible for a master to leave behind several new masters , or at his disc@@ ret@@ ion not to leave a successor and bring his line to an end .
many lines have split , and some have disappeared ; in this way some of those lines have come down from the 7th century to the present day .
enlightenment
the zen sects generally emphas@@ ize enlightenment over knowledge .
enlightenment in zen means that all living things real@@ ize the inher@@ ent buddha nature they pos@@ s@@ ess .
for this reason , masters in the tang dynasty strugg@@ led to enlightenment through much hard@@ ship .
however , they began to dev@@ ise many techniques for gaining enlightenment from the song dynasty .
these were system@@ at@@ ized so that enlightenment could be gained by performing training such as z@@ az@@ en -lrb- not the same as meditation -rrb- , koan -lrb- understanding stories that sur@@ pass intell@@ ect@@ ual understanding -rrb- , dok@@ you -lrb- reading sutras -rrb- , or sam@@ u -lrb- everyday work -rrb- under an already enlighten@@ ed zen master .
enlightenment is thought to pass from the master to the disciple as a cand@@ le fl@@ ame passes to a cand@@ le that is un@@ lit -lrb- called d@@ ent@@ ou -rrb- .
that is not a trans@@ mission based on words -lrb- lo@@ go@@ s -rrb- .
for this reason , it is considered cr@@ uc@@ ial to cho@@ ose the right zen master .
that means not just cho@@ os@@ ing one who has gained enlightenment , but one who f@@ its with one ` s own personality .
actually , it does not mean that an enlighten@@ ed zen master instruc@@ ts and en@@ ables someone gain enlightenment .
masters in the tang dynasty did not learn to get enlightenment from any@@ body - not to mention sid@@ d@@ har@@ th@@ a g@@ aut@@ ama -lrb- buddha , shak@@ us@@ on -rrb- , who gained enlightenment without a teacher .
while it is impossible to def@@ ine enlightenment with words , words are one of many methods that can describe the bound@@ aries of enlightenment .
that is why , especially after it was brought to japan , enlightenment has been expressed through art@@ istic expression such as poetry and painting , so that one can get a taste of its ar@@ oma .
other than in art , it is also expressed in de@@ port@@ ments such as tea ceremony and flower arrangement ; and methods to get a taste of the world of enlightenment have also been born .
that is not an intell@@ ect@@ ual understanding .
the koan system
the koan system came together after the song dynasty , and though they might be fab@@ ric@@ ated it has made even more enlighten@@ ments possible .
most koan are made up of conver@@ s@@ ations between a master and disciple , telling the truth of the moment when the disciple gained enlightenment .
koan can not be received with log@@ ical , intell@@ ect@@ ual understanding , and are stories beyond log@@ ic that can be understood only by completely becoming the koan itself instead of thinking .
the koan system was established by collecting these koan stories as a method for leading disciples and was composed of 500 to 1900 koan stories .
koan system differs according to the master ` s style .
examples of koan stories in the beginning .
`` does a dog have budd@@ ha@@ -@@ nature ? `` `` it does not have . ``
as the background , any buddhist know@@ s that `` all living things have budd@@ ha@@ -@@ nature . ``
the sound of one hand cl@@ apping
a disciple has to list@@ en to the sound of cl@@ apping with one hand and show that to the master .
by intell@@ ect@@ ual understanding , it is impossible to cl@@ ap with one hand and make a sound .

fushimi-jo castle was a castle in what is now fushimi ward , kyoto city .
`` fushimi mom@@ o@@ yama-jo castle `` is a recent construction that did not exist historically -lrb- details to follow -rrb- .
fushimi-jo castle was originally built by hideyoshi toyotomi for his own residence after retirement .
construction sp@@ an@@ ning the reigns of 3 emperors , it was first built on mt . shi@@ zuki , there called shi@@ zuki fushimi-jo castle , and after an earthquake was moved to mt . ko@@ hata and named ko@@ hata fushimi-jo castle .
furthermore , there was the ko@@ hata fushimi-jo castle that was built in the days of toyotomi , and the one that was rebuilt in the tokugawa days after being destroyed in the battle of sekigahara .
after hideyoshi ` s death and in accordance with his will , hideyori toyotomi moved to osaka-jo castle ; after which ieyasu tokugawa , leader of the council of 5 elders , moved into this castle and took over government .
although it was protected by ieyasu ` s vassals , motot@@ ada torii et al@@ ia , during the battle of sekigahara , it was attacked and burned by ishida -lrb- the siege of fushimi-jo castle -rrb- .
it was later rebuilt by ieyasu ; and after it was r@@ az@@ ed its structures and materials were moved to other locations .
after it was r@@ az@@ ed , the location of the cit@@ ad@@ el was made into a pe@@ ach or@@ char@@ d and was called momoyama -lrb- pe@@ ach mountain -rrb- .
that is why fushimi-jo castle is typ@@ ically called mom@@ o@@ yama-jo castle ; and this is the reason why the period of o@@ da-@@ toyotomi government is called the `` azuchi-momoyama period `` and the culture of the time called `` momoyama culture `` .
according to the account that says the descendants of the family that re@@ claimed the land are the yoshimura family , which founded yoshimura shu@@ zo , they were the heads of hor@@ i@@ uchi village , built on the ruins of fushimi-jo castle ; and it is said that they transferred village land to the imperial household in the meiji period .
historically , there was no direct connection .
since the tok@@ ug@@ awa-@@ era keep was moved to nijo-jo castle , there is a relatively large number of art@@ if@@ acts left ; but there is much that is unclear about the previous keep .
the details are unclear .
1592 - in the low@@ -l@@ ying hi@@ lls along the uji@@ -gawa river where hideyoshi toyotomi made his home on mt . shi@@ zuki in retirement , parts of the dis@@ man@@ t@@ led jur@@ aku@@ dai were transferred for the building of a castle -lrb- shi@@ zuk@@ i-jo castle -rrb- .
159@@ 6 - because it was destroyed in an earthquake , a new castle was built about 500 meters away on mt . ko@@ hata -lrb- present day mt . momoyama -rrb- .
159@@ 8 - hideyoshi toyotomi died in this castle
1600 - burned in the siege of fushimi castle
160@@ 1 - rebuilt by ieyasu tokugawa
160@@ 3 - was the site of the inaugur@@ ation of seii taishogun
fushimi-jo castle ` s functions moved to osaka-jo castle after the siege of osaka , reduc@@ ing this castle ` s importance in the eyes of the edo shogunate ; and it was therefore r@@ az@@ ed in 16@@ 25 after ieyasu tokugawa ` s retirement .
196@@ 4 - fushimi mom@@ o@@ yama-jo castle land , an am@@ us@@ ement park featuring a mo@@ c@@ k castle keep `` fushimi mom@@ o@@ yama-jo castle `` , was built on the site of the fushimi-jo castle flower garden .
january 2003 - fushimi mom@@ o@@ yama-jo castle land was closed as part of the re@@ struc@@ turing of its parent company , kintetsu corporation .
fushimi mom@@ o@@ yama-jo castle escaped destruc@@ tion thanks to a movement by the people of kyoto to preser@@ ve it as a symbol of fushimi .
nowadays it is maintained as a park .
the city of kyoto received it at no cost ; but the inside is closed to the public because it has deterior@@ ated with age .
october 2007 - when it was re@@ modeled to look like osaka-jo castle for the fil@@ ming of a period movie , `` cha@@ cha : the woman from far away `` , the t@@ ig@@ er decor@@ ations below the watch tower and sh@@ achi@@ hoko were painted gold .
with toei films bear@@ ing the re@@ mod@@ eling cost of around 1 million yen , work to re@@ make it into osaka-jo castle continues within the year .
when the castle was dis@@ man@@ t@@ led , the keep and many other buildings were moved to other locations .
the most famous are nijo-jo castle and jo@@ j@@ ak@@ ko-ji temple ; the tur@@ re@@ ts , castle gate , palace , bath , tam@@ on yagura tur@@ re@@ t , and earthen walls all were moved to fuku@@ yama-jo castle -lrb- bingo province -rrb- .
below is a list of major items that are thought to have been moved and still exist .
note : among these , the only ones that can be prov@@ en are the guest hall of sai@@ kyo@@ -ji temple , which is the remains from mt . shi@@ zuki , and fuku@@ yama-jo castle ` s fushimi yagura , which is left over from the tokugawa era .

the kan@@ o@@ ha group is the largest ga@@ ha -lrb- group of painters -rrb- in japanese art history , and was active for about 400 years from the middle of the muromachi period -lrb- fifteenth century -rrb- to the end of the edo period -lrb- ninet@@ eenth century -rrb- as a group of expert painters that consist@@ ently dominated the art world .
masanobu kano , the official painter of the muromachi shogunate , was the earli@@ est ancestor ; his descendants worked for nobunaga oda , hideyoshi toyotomi and the tokugawa shogun as painters after the collapse of the muromachi shogunate , consist@@ ently domin@@ ating the art world associated with the pow@@ er@@ s-@@ that@@ -@@ be , thus greatly influ@@ en@@ cing japanese art circles as a professional painter group working on works ran@@ ging from screen paintings in the imperial palace , castles or large temples to small paintings such as those created on fans .
the kan@@ o@@ ha group is a painter group mainly concerned with con@@ san@@ gu@@ inity such as parents or brothers ; it re@@ igned over the nation ` s realm of art for as long as four cent@@ ur@@ ies , a period un@@ equ@@ aled any@@ where in the world .
prominent painters of the kan@@ o@@ ha group include the founder masanobu kano , who worked for yoshimasa ashikaga , the eighth seii taishogun -lrb- literally , `` great general who subdues the barbarians `` -rrb- of the muromachi shogunate ; his heir , moton@@ obu kano , a grandson of moton@@ obu ; e@@ itoku kano , who created screen paintings of the azuchi and osaka castles ; a grandson of e@@ itoku , tan@@ yu kano , who moved from kyoto to edo and supervis@@ ed the creation of screen paintings of edo castle and nijo castle ; san@@ raku kano , who stayed in kyoto , thus representing a group called ` kyo kano . `
once the structure of the edo shogunate had become stable , the members of the kan@@ o@@ ha group were driven to get exten@@ sive orders done for screen paintings of the imperial palace and castles as the shogunate ` s official painters .
in order to ful@@ f@@ ill large numbers of orders for screen paintings , the head of the kano family needed to lead the painters so they could work in a group .
consequently , the painters of the kan@@ o@@ ha group needed to learn ancestral painting examples and ways of painting without expres@@ sing their individ@@ u@@ ality as painters .
given such an historical back@@ dro@@ p , it can be said that the kan@@ o@@ ha group after tan@@ yu kano only tried to keep the tradition and maintain influence as official painters , and therefore lost its art@@ istic drive .
in the present day , an artist ` s expression of individ@@ u@@ ality and ment@@ ality is valued , so the evalu@@ ation of paintings of the kan@@ o@@ ha group is not necessarily high .
however , it is a fact that the kan@@ o@@ ha group led the japanese art world for about four cent@@ ur@@ ies and that numbers of painters were developed by the group ; thus one can hardly discus@@ s the history of japanese painting but exclud@@ e the kan@@ o@@ ha group , whether in posit@@ ive or neg@@ ative terms .
it is also a fact that many japanese painters after the early years of the modern age were influenced by the kan@@ o@@ ha group and started with the influence of the kan@@ o@@ ha group ; initially , korin ogata , of the rin@@ p@@ a group , and okyo maruyama of the sh@@ as@@ ei@@ ha group had learned from the kan@@ o@@ ha group .
the kan@@ o@@ ha group was founded by masanobu kano -lrb- c . 14@@ 34 - 15@@ 30 -rrb- , who worked as the official painter for the muromachi shogunate .
he lived quite long for a japanese of the time -lrb- it is commonly believed that he died at age 9@@ 7 -rrb- , and worked from the middle of the fifteenth century until the early six@@ teenth century .
it is said that he was from the izu area , but that is uncertain .
due to the progress of study after the late twent@@ iet@@ h century , it is spec@@ ulated that the kano family was some@@ how related to the nagao clan in ashikaga , shimotsuke province -lrb- ashikaga city , tochigi prefecture -rrb- ; and `` water@@ fall , `` an ink painting that remains at chor@@ in-ji temple in ashikaga city , is considered a relatively early work by masanobu .
the first painting work recorded as having been done by masanobu is the screen paintings he did of the deity of mercy and lu@@ o@@ han in un@@ cho@@ in , shokoku-ji temple tower , which he did in kyoto at the age of 30 in 14@@ 63 . this was just before the tur@@ mo@@ il of the onin war -lrb- 14@@ 67 - 14@@ 77 -rrb- -lrb- as reported in in@@ ryok@@ en nichi@@ roku -lrb- in@@ ryok@@ en ` s diary -rrb- -rrb- , which tells us that masanobu was already working as a painter in kyoto by that time .
shokoku-ji temple , as the main temple building of un@@ cho@@ in , where masanobu created the screen paintings , is a z@@ end@@ era temple constructed by yoshimitsu ashikaga , the third shogun of the muromachi shogunate ; it is the heart of the muromachi art world , which produced art@@ ist@@ -@@ monks such as jos@@ etsu , shu@@ bun , ses@@ shu ; moreover , in those days so@@ tan -lrb- so@@ tan og@@ uri , 14@@ 13 - 14@@ 81 -rrb- , an art@@ ist@@ -@@ monk who was a disciple of shu@@ bun , worked as an official painter .
although it is not ex@@ actly certain when masanobu kano went to kyoto , whom he studied under and when he became the official painter for the muromachi shogunate , it is clear -lrb- according to certain records -rrb- that yoshimasa ashikaga , the eighth shogun of the muromachi shogunate , gave him an important position .
in 14@@ 81 , a few years after the t@@ um@@ ult@@ u@@ ous onin war -lrb- 14@@ 67 - 14@@ 77 -rrb- , which had lasted for a dec@@ ade , so@@ tan , the official painter for the muromachi shogunate , died ; thus it is thought that masanobu kano was appointed as the official painter for the shogunate , succeeding so@@ tan .
subsequently , mitsun@@ obu tosa , of the yamat@@ oe group -lrb- a style of japanese painting -rrb- who was in the post@@ ion of ed@@ ok@@ or@@ o-@@ azuk@@ ari -lrb- a leader of painters who worked for the imperial court -rrb- of the imperial court , and masanobu kano of the kan@@ ga -lrb- a chinese style of painting -rrb- group , became two major forces in the art world .
in 14@@ 82 , the former shogun , yoshimasa ashikaga , started the construction of higashiyama dono -lrb- the predecessor of gin@@ kaku-ji temple -rrb- , and masanobu took charge of the screen paintings .
following the death of yoshimasa in 14@@ 90 , masanobu worked for the hosokawa clan , which had political power at the time .
in this way masanobu solid@@ ified his position in the art world while deep@@ ening his relationship with the pow@@ er@@ s-@@ that@@ -@@ be , and built a foundation for the subsequent prosperity of the kan@@ o@@ ha group .
according to records , it is known that masanobu created works in various styles and subjects , including screen paintings and buddhist paintings ; however , all his screen paintings have been lost and the existing works are limited to small paintings such as a hanging scroll .
his painting style was ` kan@@ ga , ` with ink painting based on the bru@@ sh@@ work of sung and yuan in china , in contrast to the traditional yamat@@ oe of his contemporary , mitsun@@ obu tosa .
although masanobu lived until age 9@@ 7 , it isn ` t clear what work he produced during the last 30 years , and it seems he had his heir moton@@ obu assume the work of painting as he went into retirement .
the second generation , moton@@ obu kano -lrb- 14@@ 76 - 15@@ 59 -rrb- , who built the basis of prosperity of the kan@@ o@@ ha group , was the heir of masanobu .
his best existing works include the screen paintings in the hojo of dai@@ sen@@ in , daitoku-ji temple -lrb- the hojo , or chief priest ` s room , was completed in 15@@ 13 -rrb- and another one in rei@@ unin , myoshin-ji temple in 15@@ 43 -lrb- it is widely believed that the screen paintings in dai@@ sen@@ in were not created at the time the hojo was completed but were done in a slightly later period -rrb- .
the creation of the screen paintings in the hojo of dai@@ sen@@ in was divided among so@@ ami , moton@@ obu and his brother yuk@@ inobu kano , depending on the room ; accordingly , moton@@ obu took charge of `` four seasons , flowers and birds `` in ` dan@@ na no ma ` and `` founder of the zen@@ shu sect `` in ` i@@ h@@ atsu no ma . `
`` founder of zen@@ shu sect `` is a typical ink painting , while `` four seasons , flowers and birds `` is based on ink and shows a new flavor at the same time , as it uses colors only on the flowers and birds .
moton@@ obu strengthened the ties with the ashikaga shogun and the hosokawa clan as the pow@@ er@@ s-@@ that@@ -@@ be , had numerous disciples and consolid@@ ated the basis of the kan@@ o@@ ha as a group of painters .
he accepted orders from court nobles , temples and shrines as well as samurai families ; and as for temples and shrines it is known that he created the screen paintings of ishiyama hongan-ji temple in osaka according to the historical record , but this no longer exists .
because moton@@ obu referred to himself as ` echizen no kami ` in his later life , he was given a priest@@ ly rank called ` hogen ` however , for post@@ er@@ ity he has been referred to as ` ko@@ hogen ` or ` echizen hogen . `
the work is wid@@ e@@ -ran@@ ging : he created the engi emaki of temples and shrines , v@@ ot@@ ive pictures , g@@ il@@ ded folding screens in the yamat@@ oe style , and portraits as well as screen paintings .
moton@@ obu assumed the yamat@@ oe painting style in kan@@ ga and ink painting -lrb- in which his father masanobu specialized -rrb- ; he specialized in large decorative paintings such as a fusuma -lrb- japanese sliding door -rrb- and a folding screen , and built a foundation for the style of the kan@@ o@@ ha group .
he is also called the founder of the early modern screen paintings as he established the concept of calligraphy painting styles such as shin@@ tai -lrb- standard style -rrb- , gyo@@ tai -lrb- semi-@@ cur@@ sive style -rrb- , and so@@ tai -lrb- cur@@ sive style -rrb- .
moton@@ obu had three sons : mun@@ enobu , hideyori and na@@ on@@ obu ; na@@ on@@ obu -lrb- 15@@ 19 - 1592 -rrb- ; the first , mun@@ enobu , died young , and the third son na@@ on@@ obu succeeded as the head of family .
it is not clear why their family estate was transferred to the third son na@@ on@@ obu instead of hideyori , the second son .
na@@ on@@ obu is widely known as sho@@ ei kano -lrb- his posthumous name -rrb- , and he was active from the muromachi period to the momoyama period .
the huge `` nirvana `` -lrb- six meters long -rrb- in daitoku-ji temple is his fin@@ est work .
although he participated in the creation of the screen paintings for the ishiyama hongan-ji temple with his father moton@@ obu as well as in the creation of the screen paintings for the ju@@ ko@@ in , daitoku-ji temple with his son e@@ itoku , he was a less famous artist because his father moton@@ obu and his son e@@ itoku were more prominent .
e@@ itoku kano -lrb- 15@@ 43 - 1590 -rrb- , the heir of sho@@ ei , is also called kunin@@ obu ; he is one of the most distinguished painters of the japanese art world from the momoyama period .
although he created numbers of screen paintings in strict compl@@ iance with the plans of the men in power who had survived wild times -- including nobunaga oda and hideyoshi toyotomi -- these paintings were lost with the buildings , so relatively few of e@@ itoku ` s works remain in existence .
the paintings on the par@@ tit@@ ions in the hojo of ju@@ ko@@ in , daitoku-ji temple -lrb- which are among his best existing works -rrb- were created by e@@ itoku together with his father sho@@ ei ; however , sho@@ ei had e@@ itoku take charge of fu@@ su@@ mae of the major room in the south front of the hojo , while he took a supporting role .
in the days of feudal society it was a common practice that the head of a family would create fu@@ su@@ mae in the major room , so it is historically believed that , at the time such paintings were created , sho@@ ei had already retired after transf@@ er@@ ring the family estate to e@@ itoku , who was a great talent .
`` flowers and birds `` in shit@@ chu -lrb- the center front room of hojo -rrb- is very highly ac@@ claimed among the screen paintings of hojo of ju@@ ko@@ in .
subsequently , e@@ itoku became involved in the creation of the screen paintings in azuchi castle tower , which nobunaga oda constructed during the period from 157@@ 6 to 157@@ 9 .
he created screen paintings in the osaka castle of hideyoshi toyotomi and jur@@ aku@@ dai after nobunaga died , and in his later years also became involved in creating the screen paintings in the imperial palace .
these works were highly ac@@ claimed for their origin@@ ality in the jour@@ n@@ als and records of the time , so they would be e@@ itoku ` s best works if they existed ; however , these paintings were lost with the buildings .
as e@@ itoku ` s existing best works , the screen paintings in the hojo of ju@@ ko@@ in , as previously described , are ren@@ owned as well as `` fo@@ o dog@@ s , folding screen `` as former imperial property , and `` urban and sub@@ ur@@ b of kyoto , folding screen , `` as handed down through the uesugi clan ; it has also been said that `` cypress , folding screen `` in the tokyo national museum was painted by e@@ itoku .
e@@ itoku excelled at el@@ abor@@ ate paintings and mon@@ um@@ ental paintings , although he had no cho@@ ice but to pain@@ t in the mon@@ um@@ ental painting style in order to f@@ ill a large number of orders for screen paintings .
an el@@ abor@@ ate painting is interpreted as a work described in every detail , and mon@@ um@@ ental painting is interpreted as having a high-@@ min@@ ded style .
the kan@@ o@@ ha group also had the most important painters in the early modern ages .
`` viewing m@@ ap@@ le leaves in tak@@ ao , `` a designated national treasure , has the seal of ` hideyori ` ; it has been said that this was painted by hideyori kano -lrb- birth and death dates unknown -rrb- , the second son of moton@@ obu kano ; however , it is also said that this ` hideyori ` of `` viewing m@@ ap@@ le leaves in tak@@ ao `` is another painter called hideyori shinsho , a grandson of moton@@ obu .
so@@ shu kano -lrb- 15@@ 51 - 160@@ 1 -rrb- was a brother of e@@ itoku , also called moto@@ hide , and worked as an assistant to e@@ itoku in the creation of the screen paintings in azuchi castle .
folding screens and portraits still in existence have been attributed to him .
nagan@@ obu kano -lrb- 157@@ 7 - 16@@ 54 -rrb- , another brother of e@@ itoku , is ren@@ owned as the painter of `` playing under the flow@@ ering trees , `` a national treasure .
as painters other than the direct line of the kano family , yoshinobu kano -lrb- 15@@ 52 - 16@@ 40 -rrb- , who painted `` craft@@ speople , folding screen `` in kawag@@ oe kit@@ ain , and nai@@ zen kano -lrb- 157@@ 0 - 16@@ 16 -rrb- , who painted `` hok@@ oku festival , folding screen `` in kyoto toyok@@ un@@ i-jinja shrine -lrb- kyoto city -rrb- , are well known .
e@@ itoku kano died at age 48 , prec@@ eding his father sho@@ ei -lrb- na@@ on@@ obu -rrb- .
e@@ itoku ` s first son mitsun@@ obu kano -lrb- c . 156@@ 5 - 160@@ 8 -rrb- and second son takan@@ obu kano -lrb- 157@@ 1 - 16@@ 18 -rrb- succeeded him .
mitsun@@ obu created the screen paintings in the rec@@ eption hall of kan@@ gaku@@ in , onjo-ji temple ; in contrast to e@@ itoku he specialized in delic@@ ate painting in the yamat@@ oe style .
such a style of painting might not have su@@ ited the public taste at the time , and the early modern ess@@ ays on paintings , including `` hon@@ chog@@ ashi , `` generally put a low value on mitsun@@ obu .
after the death of the kano ｆ@@ am@@ ily head mitsun@@ obu , his brother takan@@ obu led the kan@@ o@@ ha group because his son sadan@@ obu kano -lrb- 159@@ 7 - 16@@ 23 -rrb- was only 12 years of age .
under the feudal system , the family line of sadan@@ obu , mitsun@@ obu ` s first son , was supposed to be the head of family ; however , sadan@@ obu died without an heir at the age of just 27 , so after that the legit@@ im@@ acy of the kano family was the descendant of takan@@ obu t@@ ill the end of the edo period .
takan@@ obu had three sons -- mor@@ inobu -lrb- tan@@ yu 160@@ 2 - 16@@ 74 -rrb- , na@@ on@@ obu kano -lrb- 160@@ 7 - 16@@ 50 -rrb- and yas@@ unobu kano -lrb- 16@@ 13 - 168@@ 5 -rrb- -- and they respectively became the earli@@ est ancestor of the kaji@@ bashi kano family , kob@@ ik@@ i@@ cho kano family and nak@@ abashi kano family .
although the youngest son , yas@@ unobu , succeeded as the kano head of family as an adopted son of sadan@@ obu -lrb- mentioned above -rrb- , the most ren@@ owned painter was mor@@ inobu -lrb- also known as tan@@ yu -rrb- .
mor@@ inobu later became a priest and called himself tan@@ yusai ; as a painter he is known as tan@@ yu kano .
he eventually moved to edo and solid@@ ified the position of the kan@@ o@@ ha group in the art world more as the official painter of the edo shogunate .
tan@@ yu exerc@@ ised his painting talent from childhood ; in 16@@ 12 , he met ieyasu tok@@ unaga in sun@@ pu at the age of 11 and obtained a residence in edo kaji@@ bashi mon@@ g@@ ai in 16@@ 21 , subsequent to which he worked based in edo and ener@@ get@@ ically created screen paintings in castles and large temples .
among tan@@ yu ` s works , the screen paintings in the edo and osaka castles were lost with the buildings , but the screen paintings -lrb- ink paintings -rrb- in jor@@ ak@@ uden of nagoya castle are exist@@ ent , having avoided an air raid during world war ii because they had been removed from the building and ev@@ ac@@ u@@ ated ; additionally , the screen paintings in nin@@ omaru palace of nijo castle and the hojo of daitoku-ji temple are among his best exist@@ ent works .
he created various kinds of works , including hanging ro@@ lls , picture scrolls and folding screens , as well as these large paintings .
he created the screen paintings in nin@@ omaru palace of nijo castle when he was young -lrb- 25 years of age -rrb- , and they showed dy@@ nam@@ ism in e@@ itoku ` s style ; however , the screen paintings in daitoku-ji temple , which he created later in his life -lrb- mainly with ink and water -rrb- , display a cal@@ m approach with ab@@ und@@ ant use of bl@@ an@@ k space .
he had works in the yamat@@ oe style in picture scrolls and folding screens as well .
tan@@ yu emphasized sk@@ et@@ ches and the cop@@ ying of ancient paintings ; consequently , he left numerous sk@@ et@@ ch books and re@@ production books .
many of tan@@ yu ` s copies of ancient paintings -lrb- called ` tan@@ yu reduc@@ tion ` -rrb- are exist@@ ent , which are now part of mus@@ eums and collections around the nation , and they include many copies of ancient paintings whose origin@@ als are now lost , so they are valuable as data for the study of japanese art history .
the kan@@ o@@ ha group during the edo period was a huge painting group comprised of a con@@ san@@ gu@@ inity group mainly with the head family of the kano family and numerous disciples around the nation , thus com@@ pris@@ ing a hier@@ archy .
they are clearly ranked : under the most pre@@ st@@ ig@@ ious four families -lrb- called ` inner court painters ` -rrb- there are about 15 families less pre@@ st@@ ig@@ ious called ` outer court painters ` and then the ` machi kano painters ` who cat@@ ered to the dem@@ ands of townspeople instead of the imperial court or temples and shrines ; and consequently their influence spread throughout the nation .
the powers of the time sought the st@@ ability and continu@@ ity of feudal society , and the paintings for public places such as edo castle were supposed to be painted in the style of traditional painting examples ; they were not intended to be unique .
in order to create numbers of screen paintings , one must work in a group with all the disciples ; therefore , in order to make group work eas@@ ier , the ability to learn from painting examples was valued more than one ` s individ@@ u@@ ality as a painter .
in this respect it is und@@ eni@@ able that the paintings of the kan@@ o@@ ha group lack individ@@ u@@ ality and origin@@ ality .
it is said that the inner court painters ranked with hatamoto and were allowed ` audience ` with the shogun as well as bel@@ ting on a sword , which impl@@ ies a high status .
the four families of the inner court painters are the kaji@@ bashi family , with lineage of tan@@ yu -lrb- the first son of takan@@ obu kano -rrb- ; the kob@@ ik@@ i@@ cho family -lrb- called take@@ kaw@@ a-cho family at the time -rrb- , with lineage of na@@ on@@ obu -lrb- the second son of takan@@ obu -rrb- ; the nak@@ abashi family with lineage of yas@@ unobu -lrb- the third son of takan@@ obu -rrb- ; and the ham@@ a@@ cho family , with lineage of min@@ enobu kano -lrb- 16@@ 62 - 170@@ 8 -rrb- -lrb- min@@ enobu is the second son of tsun@@ enobu kano , the first son of na@@ on@@ obu kano -rrb- .
because tan@@ yu had no child , he adopted tou@@ n -lrb- mas@@ unobu kano 16@@ 25 - 169@@ 4 -rrb- , the son of ryu@@ jo goto , a sword@@ sm@@ ith .
later , mor@@ imasa kano -lrb- 16@@ 53 - 17@@ 18 -rrb- who was his biological son -lrb- born after tan@@ yu turned 50 -rrb- succeeded him , but subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter .
among the numerous disciples of tan@@ yu , mor@@ ik@@ age ku@@ sumi -lrb- birth and death dates unknown -rrb- , the cre@@ ator of `` enjo@@ ying the co@@ ol of the evening under the mo@@ on@@ flower tre@@ ll@@ is , `` is ren@@ owned .
mor@@ ik@@ age was for some reason expelled from the kan@@ o@@ ha group ; he worked in the kanazawa area later , but his records ar@@ en ` t completely clear .
as stated previously , the head family of kano was succeeded by the nak@@ abashi family of yas@@ unobu , a brother of tan@@ yu .
tok@@ inobu kano -lrb- 16@@ 42 - 16@@ 78 -rrb- , a son of yas@@ unobu , died in his thir@@ ties , and his son ujin@@ obu kano -lrb- 16@@ 75 - 17@@ 24 -rrb- succeeded the family estate ; however , subsequently this lineage had no distinguished painter .
it@@ cho han@@ ab@@ usa -lrb- 16@@ 52 - 17@@ 24 -rrb- , who was popular based on his sop@@ hi@@ stic@@ ated painting style , was a disciple of yas@@ unobu .
the family that produced relatively prominent painters until the end of the edo period among the four families of the inner court painters is the kob@@ ik@@ i@@ cho family , of na@@ on@@ obu ` s lineage .
this family line produced tsun@@ enobu kano -lrb- 16@@ 36 - 17@@ 13 -rrb- , the heir of na@@ on@@ obu , and tsun@@ enobu ` s sons , chi@@ kan@@ obu kano -lrb- 16@@ 60 - 17@@ 28 -rrb- and min@@ enobu kano -lrb- 16@@ 62 - 170@@ 8 -rrb- .
min@@ enobu won the favor of the shogun ien@@ obu tokugawa , and he later gained independence as ` ham@@ a@@ cho family , ` which was ranked as one of the inner court painter families .
besides them , koi kano -lrb- date of birth unknown - 16@@ 36 -rrb- was not related by blood to the kano family but , along with his brothers , was a master of tan@@ yu ; he was allowed to use the surname of kano due to his achievements , and he worked for the kishu tokugawa family .
meanwhile , a group called ` kyo kano ` remained active in kyoto , and san@@ raku kano -lrb- 15@@ 59 - 16@@ 35 -rrb- , a disciple of e@@ itoku kano , was the pillar of the group .
san@@ raku was from the kim@@ ura clan in omi , the vassal of hideyoshi toyotomi ; his original name was mitsu@@ yori kim@@ ura .
his best works are `` pe@@ on@@ ies `` and `` red and white plum trees `` in the main house of kyoto daik@@ aku-ji temple , and they have col@@ or@@ ful and decorative pictures on a golden base .
san@@ setsu kano -lrb- 158@@ 9 / 90 - 16@@ 51 -rrb- , the husband of san@@ raku ` s daughter , created the screen paintings in ten@@ kyu@@ in , myoshin-ji temple as well as some paintings of folding screens , which are still in existence .
he had a distinc@@ tive painting style unique among painters of the kan@@ o@@ ha group , such as distinc@@ t shapes of trees and rocks , as well as the complet@@ eness of detail .
the ess@@ ay on paintings made by san@@ setsu and edited by his son e@@ ino kano -lrb- 16@@ 31 - 169@@ 7 -rrb- is entitled `` hon@@ chog@@ ashi , `` the first full-@@ fl@@ edge painting history book by a japanese .
the kob@@ ik@@ i@@ cho family produced michin@@ obu kano -lrb- michin@@ obu e@@ is@@ enin -lrb- 17@@ 30 - 17@@ 90 -rrb- -rrb- , kor@@ enobu kano -lrb- kor@@ enobu yos@@ enin -lrb- 17@@ 53 - 180@@ 8 -rrb- -rrb- , nagan@@ obu kano -lrb- nagan@@ obu is@@ enin -lrb- 17@@ 75 - 18@@ 28 -rrb- -rrb- and os@@ an@@ obu kano -lrb- os@@ an@@ obu se@@ is@@ enin -lrb- 178@@ 6 - 184@@ 6 -rrb- -rrb- during the late edo period .
os@@ an@@ obu se@@ is@@ enin led the creation of numerous screen paintings as a master of the kan@@ o@@ ha group during the reconstruction of the nishin@@ omaru and honmaru pal@@ aces of edo castle , which had burned down in 18@@ 38 and again in 184@@ 4 .
although the paintings are no longer in existence , numerous designs are in the possession of the tokyo national museum .
se@@ is@@ enin also end@@ ea@@ v@@ ored to copy and collect ancient paintings .
although the painters of the kan@@ o@@ ha group in the late edo period are not well appreciated generally , there is a move to re@@ ap@@ prai@@ se se@@ is@@ enin as the progress of the study after the late twent@@ iet@@ h century recogn@@ izes that he was a painter with good technique who e@@ ag@@ erly studied art from ancient paintings and on to the new painting movement at the end of the edo period .
hog@@ ai kano -lrb- born in shimon@@ oseki , 18@@ 28 - 1888 -rrb- , a leading figure of the japanese art world during the early meiji period , like ga@@ ho hashimoto -lrb- born in kawag@@ oe , 18@@ 35 - 1908 -rrb- , was a disciple of tadan@@ obu kano -lrb- tadan@@ obu shos@@ en ` in 18@@ 23 - 1880 -rrb- , the next generation of se@@ is@@ enin .
both hog@@ ai and ga@@ ho were from painter families of the kan@@ o@@ ha group .
the historical role of the kan@@ o@@ ha group as a professional painter group finished as its pat@@ ron , the edo shogunate , ended .
personal information of emperor shirakawa
emperor shirakawa -lrb- 7th july 10@@ 53 - 2@@ 4th july 112@@ 9 -rrb- was the 7@@ 2nd emperor .
shirakawa came to power on the 18th january 10@@ 73 and re@@ igned until 5th an@@ uary 10@@ 87 .
his posthumous name was sada@@ hito .
shirakawa was the first son of emperor go-@@ sanjo who had little maternal relationship with the fujiwara five regent houses , and his mother , nyogo , fujiwara no mo@@ shi / shige@@ ko was from fujiwara kan@@ in@@ ryu , the daughter of chunagon fujiwara no kin@@ n@@ ari , and the adopted daughter of togu daibu fujiwara no yoshinobu .
his half sister was princess tok@@ ushi / atsuko -lrb- empress of horikawa -rrb-
genealogy
when he was young , he and his father were s@@ nu@@ b@@ bed due to their background , but after his father was enthroned in 10@@ 68 -lrb- jir@@ yaku 4 -rrb- , he was proclaimed a shinno -lrb- imperial prince -rrb- and became imperial prince sada@@ hito .
in 10@@ 69 he became crown prince , and became an emperor three years later , when he was twenty years old .
a kanpaku was assigned , but shirakawa attempted to rule directly like his father had done , after his father , the retired emperor , died of illness in 10@@ 70 -lrb- jir@@ yaku 5 -rrb- , and also attempted to reg@@ ulate the shoen -lrb- manor -rrb- system thereby trying to weak@@ en the influence of the regent / kanpaku houses .
go-@@ san@@ jo-in and go-@@ san@@ jo-in ` s mother , yom@@ e@@ im@@ on-in , wi@@ shed for shirakawa ` s younger half brother , prince sane@@ hito -lrb- heian period -rrb- and then sane@@ hito ` s younger brother prince suke@@ hito to succeed to the throne , and upon abdic@@ ation to shirakawa , prince sane@@ hito was decided to become crown prince .
shirak@@ ara rep@@ elled against this and later prince sane@@ hiro died from illness in 10@@ 85 -lrb- o@@ toku 2 -rrb- .
as a result , in november , 10@@ 86 -lrb- o@@ toku 3 -rrb- , shirakawa proclaimed his own eight year old son , prince tar@@ uhito -lrb- 7@@ 3rd emperor horikawa -rrb- to be the crown prince instead of prince suke@@ hito and shirakawa abdicated immediately .
retired emperor shirakawa , who became daijo tenno , acted as the guardian of the young emperor , and ruled person@@ ally as shirak@@ awa-@@ in , and this style of government became known as insei system -lrb- cloistered style -rrb- .
through such system , although the sessho and kam@@ p@@ aku offices continued , they did not have actual power to rule the government .
shirakawa continued to have exer@@ t power even after emperor horikawa turned twenty years old and he strengthened his des@@ pot@@ ic position by appoin@@ ting ai@@ ds from the jur@@ y@@ ro and samurai class .
the samurai soldiers were assigned to such posts as the `` hok@@ um@@ en no bushi `` which was newly established to protect the retired emperor .
shirakawa was a strict buddhist and he became a cloistered emperor with posthumous buddhist name of yuk@@ an after the death of his daughter in 109@@ 6 -lrb- ka@@ ho 3 -rrb- .
shirakawa ordered the building of many temples and buddhist statues including the hos@@ sho-ji temple , and he took advantage of getting finance from jur@@ yo .
after emperor horikawa died , shirakawa ruled using a cloistered government for for@@ ty three years through three generations of young emperors , until he died on 2@@ 4th july 112@@ 9 -lrb- 7th july tai@@ ji 4 -rrb- , and he supported both his grandson 7@@ 4th emperor toba and his great grandson 7@@ 5th emperor sutoku .
this is called `` chiten no kimi `` .
the cloistered emperor shirakawa had supreme power , but it was said he ment@@ ed that , he has no control over the following three things : 1 . wat@@ ers of the kamo river -lrb- tribut@@ ary of the yodo river -rrb- -lrb- due to its flow and frequ@@ ent flo@@ od@@ ing -rrb- ; 2 . d@@ ice used in sug@@ oroku -lrb- different from current sug@@ oroku , close to western back@@ gam@@ mon -rrb- , which was popular way of gam@@ bling at that time , with spots on the d@@ ice sel@@ ecting win@@ ners / los@@ ers ; and 3 . yam@@ abo@@ shi -lrb- monk soldiers from mt . hi@@ e enryaku-ji temple -rrb- , which show that shirakawa had absol@@ ute control apart from these three things .
shirakawa is also known for many relationships with women and the rumor that emperor sutoku and taira no kiyomori may be shirakawa ` s illegitimate sons , was widely spread and believed at the time .

the pro@@ gen@@ itor of this family was kanezane kujo , the third son of fujiwara no tadamichi , a direct descendant of the fuji@@ war@@ a-@@ hokke -lrb- the northern house of the fujiwara clan -rrb- .
the family name comes from the fact that the kujo family lived in ku@@ jo-@@ den , which was located in kyoto kujo and said to have been built by fujiwara no mototsune .
this individual was a d@@ uke after the meiji restoration .
the crest is ku@@ jo-@@ fuji crest .

the children of michi@@ ie kujo , a grandchild of kanezane -- nor@@ izane kujo , yoshi@@ zane kujo and sanet@@ sune kujo -- became regents to the emperor and started the kujo family , nijo family and ichijo family , respectively , thus constitut@@ ing gos@@ ek@@ ke .
kanezane kujo inherited the fief of the elder sister by a different mother , kok@@ am@@ onin , which became the foundation of the kujo family f@@ ief@@ dom .
kanezane was critical of the taira clan administration and pop@@ e goshirakawa ; he became regent by recommendation of minamoto no yoritomo and then chief advisor to the emperor , where@@ upon the konoe and kujo families took positions as regents to the emperor .
kanezane ` s grandson , michi@@ ie kujo , gained power in the imperial court since michi@@ ie ` s son yorit@@ sune kujo , and then yorit@@ sune ` s son yorit@@ sugu kujo , became sek@@ ke shogun in the kamakura shogunate .
kanezane ` s diary , `` gyokuyo -lrb- kanezane kujo ` s diary -rrb- , `` is famous .
the kujo family ` s f@@ ief@@ dom continued to exp@@ and during medieval times . they held the l@@ ord@@ ship of kar@@ oku , an area of land that yi@@ elded 2,000 koku of rice in the edo era and 3,000 koku later on , until the meiji era .
set@@ suko , the fourth daughter of the d@@ uke michitaka kujo , who was hi@@ sat@@ ada kujo ` s first@@ born , became empress to the emperor taisho -lrb- empress te@@ imei -rrb- .
conflict over legitimate blood between the kujo and ichijo families
michi@@ ie kujo lost the legitimate heir , nor@@ izane kujo , and the second son , yoshi@@ zane kujo , was pract@@ ically re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated .
michi@@ ie gave tad@@ aie kujo , nor@@ izane ` s son and michi@@ ie ` s grandchild , to be the legitimate heir , a sho@@ bun@@ jo -lrb- a kind of will -rrb- to give instructions that documents such as di@@ aries -lrb- which were the most important heritage for a court noble at the time -rrb- should be inherited by the ichijo family , but that the head of a family who contro@@ ls the family temples such as tofuku-ji temple should first be inherited by sanet@@ sune ichijo , the third son of michi@@ ie , then by tad@@ aie kujo , a child of the eldest son of michi@@ ie , and later by either descendant of the kujo family or the ichijo family who took the high@@ est@@ -ranking official position -lrb- head of a clan -rrb- .
in accordance with michi@@ ie ` s will , sanet@@ sune ichijo ` s descendant inherited the position as head of the family after michi@@ ie died .
thereafter , the pre@@ domin@@ ance of the ichijo family was maintained for over 100 years , whereby the position of the ichijo family as legitimate blood of ku@@ jo@@ -ryu -lrb- kujo family line -rrb- was well established .
when tsun@@ emichi ichijo died in 13@@ 65 -lrb- the hoku@@ cho period -rrb- , during the muromachi era , tsun@@ enori kujo -- who had gained the second position of power after the ichijo family -- made an appeal to the emperor gok@@ og@@ on that fus@@ at@@ sune ichijo , a son of tsun@@ emichi , had fr@@ aud@@ ul@@ ently identified himself as the head of family .
at that time , prim@@ og@@ en@@ iture was becoming the common practice , and tsun@@ enori claimed that according to prim@@ og@@ en@@ iture the kujo family , the descendant of the eldest son of michi@@ ie , should inher@@ it the family estate .
fus@@ at@@ sune ichijo argued against tsun@@ enori , stating that just because an ancestor of the kujo family was the first@@ born child it did not mean the kujo family was the legitimate blood of ku@@ jo@@ -ryu , and that because michi@@ ie kujo gave the family estate to sanet@@ sune ichijo , the tok@@ ad@@ o-@@ bunko -lrb- gon@@ n@@ jo-@@ mor@@ om@@ ichi@@ -@@ ki -rrb- -lrb- gon@@ i@@ jo-@@ mor@@ om@@ ichi record -rrb- , gyokuyo -lrb- kanezane kujo ` s diary -rrb- and gyoku@@ zui -lrb- michi@@ ie kujo ` s diary -rrb- -rrb- and the document end@@ or@@ sing the political authority of ku@@ jo@@ -ryu sekkan-ke , a regent family , were inherited by the ichijo family ; whereas tsun@@ enori kujo asser@@ ted that measures to give inheritance to sanet@@ sune were taken just because tad@@ aie kujo was in infan@@ cy , and that if nor@@ izane kujo had lived longer it would not have happened .
tun@@ enori further asser@@ ted that tad@@ aie kujo was named as the rece@@ iv@@ er of the sho@@ bun@@ jo -lrb- execut@@ or of the will -rrb- and the land pat@@ ent of the premis@@ e of tofuku-ji temple had been inherited by the kujo family because the kujo was the legitimate blood .
considering the political position of the kujo family at that time , the emperor gave rin@@ ji to the kujo family on november 29 -lrb- lunar calendar -rrb- , in the same year giving the ver@@ dic@@ t that the will of michi@@ ie was no more than the inheritance of the head of a family by the head of a clan and that the kujo and ichijo families , both having the qual@@ ification , were on equal fo@@ oting as legitimate blood .
the ichijo family was the legitimate blood of ku@@ jo@@ -ryu during the kamakura era , but after the middle muromachi period the position of the kujo family was elevated and the ichijo and kujo families were considered to be the legitimate blood of ku@@ jo@@ -ryu .
the kujo family started inher@@ iting the matsu@@ dono family ` s f@@ ief@@ dom after the middle edo period ; thus the kujo possessed the largest kok@@ ud@@ aka , lived in a huge house and claimed to be the legitimate blood of ku@@ jo@@ -ryu .

old ku@@ jo-@@ tei was in the south@@ west area of the present-day kyoto gyo@@ en .
today only the garden remains , on the basis of maintenance .
itsuk@@ ushi@@ ma@@ -jinja shrine , which was then called chinju-@@ sha , still exists on the island of the garden pond -lrb- ku@@ jo-@@ ike -rrb- , and a simple but elegant t@@ ear@@ o@@ om called shu@@ su@@ i-@@ tei is found near the pond .
the major buildings -lrb- such as the main building -rrb- were transferred to ku@@ jo-@@ tei in tokyo in accordance with the order issued during the early meiji era , and were recently donated by the kujo family to the tokyo national museum , which was named ku@@ jo-@@ kan .
yamashiro no kuni , located in kinai , was one of the administrative province -lrb- ryos@@ ei@@ koku -rrb- .
it was situated in the southern part of present day kyoto .
it was also called joshu -lrb- un@@ usually it is also al@@ led san@@ shu -rrb- or yoshu .
in the engishiki , it is ranked as kok@@ ushi@@ -@@ kuni tok@@ yu -lrb- a kokushi -lrb- official -rrb- governing province -rrb- .
`` yamashiro `` was written as 山@@ 代 in ancient times , and in the 7th century , the province -lrb- kuni -rrb- was founded with the name written as 山@@ 背@@ 国 .
on november 8 , 79@@ 4 -lrb- enry@@ aku 13 -rrb- , when the capital was named heian-kyo -lrb- heian palace -rrb- , the emperor kam@@ mu changed the second letter of the province ` s name to 山@@ 城@@ 国
based on the writings of `` mok@@ kan `` － stri@@ ps of wood used for writing during the heijo-kyo -lrb- hei@@ jo palace -rrb- period , the not@@ ations of yamashiro no kuni as 山@@ 代@@ 国 and 山@@ 背@@ 国 seem to have co@@ existed with 山@@ 城@@ 国 .
according to w@@ am@@ yo rui@@ ju@@ sho , the provincial government office -lrb- kokufu -rrb- was situated at the kaya imperial villa -lrb- kaya detached palace -rrb- .
on the other hand , it is recorded as `` otok@@ un@@ i-gun -lrb- otok@@ uni district -rrb- , fu -lrb- office -rrb- `` in shug@@ aisho .
in the col@@ op@@ hon and afterward titled `` kei@@ cho-@@ two en@@ ir@@ in@@ shi `` of setsu@@ yoshu -lrb- pro@@ of@@ ed by e@@ kir@@ in -rrb- it is also recorded as `` otok@@ un@@ i-gun -lrb- otok@@ uni district -rrb- , fu -lrb- office -rrb- . ``
as for shugo@@ sho -lrb- governor ` s office -rrb- , at first , the mansion of the gokenin of kyoto shugo -lrb- kyoto governor -rrb- was designated because the person holding the post of kyoto shugo concurrently took charge of yamashiro province ` s shugo .
later , rokuhara tandai held the post of the province shugo , and therefore , the office -lrb- shugo@@ sho -rrb- was moved to rokuhara .
in muromachi period , the yamashiro province was divided along the uji river into three upper districts and five lower districts ; after an associ@@ ate shugo -lrb- shugodai -rrb- was designated to each district the shugo@@ sho in charge of the three upper districts was situated in uji mak@@ is@@ hima , while shugo@@ sho for the five lower districts were placed in several places such as yodo .
ichin@@ omiya -lrb- primary shrine -rrb- , provincial monast@@ ery -lrb- temple -rrb- , and others
the provincial temple － with monast@@ ery for priests as well as conv@@ ent for priest@@ ess － , were located in sor@@ aku district .
the dai@@ gok@@ uden hall of the kuni no miya shrine was designated as a monast@@ ery -lrb- so@@ ji -rrb- in 7@@ 46 .
it was burned down in 8@@ 82 .
afterwards it was reconstructed but its influence declined .
in kamakura period , it seems that the temple was categorized as the lowest level temple within the b@@ yodo-@@ in school
the provincial temple was located at present day kam@@ o-cho , kiz@@ ugawa city .
in 1925 -lrb- 14th year of taisho -rrb- a large number of old -lsb- roof -rsb- tiles were excavated near the provincial temple , and impl@@ ying that there was a conv@@ ent there .
in eng@@ i-@@ shiki jin@@ mei@@ -cho -lrb- shrines ` name direc@@ tory -rrb- a total of 12@@ 2-@@ za and 9@@ 6-@@ sha are recorded , consisting of 5@@ 3-@@ za / 3@@ 7-@@ sha of taisha -lrb- big shrines -rrb- -lrb- within these shrines , 2@@ 3-@@ za / 16@@ -@@ sha of dai myojin are included -rrb- and 69@@ -@@ za / 5@@ 9@@ -@@ sha of sho@@ sha -lrb- small shrines -rrb- . in addition to these shrines , 3@@ 6-@@ za -lrb- 30 big za , and 6 small za -rrb- in the imperial court and 3-@@ dai@@ za in kyoto are also registered .
kamo shrines are the first shrines -lrb- ichin@@ omiya -rrb- in kyoto － kam@@ ow@@ ak@@ ei@@ kaz@@ uchi shrine -lrb- called kamig@@ amo shrine -rrb- at kita district , and kam@@ omi@@ oya shrine -lrb- called shimo@@ gamo shrine -rrb- at sakyo district .
unlike in other local provinces , it is considered that jing@@ i-@@ kan had some influence over the designation of the first shrine -lrb- ichin@@ omiya -rrb- in yamashiro province ; because of this , while the establishment of ichin@@ omiya in other provinces took place starting at the end of the 11th century the designation of ichin@@ omiya in kinai -lrb- kansai region -rrb- began during the 12th century .
there is no secon@@ dary -lrb- nin@@ omiya -rrb- and lower level shrines .
as for the so@@ ja shrine , the information is not available .

the ik@@ ed@@ aya incident is the name given to an event that took place on july 8@@ ,@@ 1864 towards the end of the edo period in which the shinsen@@ -gumi , who was a peac@@ e@@ keeping organization under the kyoto prot@@ ect@@ or@@ ate , attacked the imperial loy@@ alist faction from choshu who were hiding out at the ik@@ ed@@ aya inn at ki@@ yam@@ achi -lrb- san@@ j@@ ou@@ -@@ ko@@ bashi bridge -rrb- on san@@ j@@ ou@@ -@@ street in kyoto .
it is also known as the ik@@ ed@@ aya rebellion , the ik@@ ed@@ aya uprising , or the san@@ j@@ ou@@ -@@ ko@@ bashi disturbance .
isami kondo called it the raku@@ yo up@@ heav@@ al in his writings .
kyoto at the end of the edo period was the center of political power strugg@@ les , and ron@@ ins -lrb- masterless samurai -rrb- from different feudal clans who held such ideas as `` rev@@ ere the emperor , ex@@ pe@@ l foreigners `` and imperi@@ al@@ ists were active behind the scenes .
the choshu clan was overthro@@ wn by the aizu and satsuma clans in a coup on august 18th , and the shogun@@ at@@ e-@@ imperial faction became the mainstream in the imperial court .
the `` rev@@ ere the emperor , ex@@ pe@@ l foreigners `` faction was trying to reco@@ ver its strength , and the kyoto prot@@ ect@@ or@@ ate used the shinsen@@ -gumi for security and sear@@ ches in the city .
at around the end of may , mod@@ er@@ ators and observ@@ ers including su@@ sum@@ u yamazaki and kai shimada as@@ cer@@ tained the presence of masu@@ ya store -lrb- sh@@ unt@@ aro fur@@ ut@@ aka -rrb- that was operating a charcoal business in shi@@ jo-@@ kob@@ ashi-@@ ag@@ ar@@ u-@@ shin@@ -cho , and made a report to the aizu clan .
weapons and commun@@ ic@@ ations with the choshu clan were found .
the shinsen@@ -gumi cap@@ tors requested toshizo hijikata to tor@@ ture fur@@ ut@@ aka , who was co@@ er@@ ced into a conf@@ ession .
the plan was to wait for a win@@ d@@ y day before the gion festival and set fire to the kyoto imperial palace , and in the en@@ su@@ ing confusion confin@@ ing prince asa@@ hiko nakag@@ awanomiya -lrb- who became asa@@ hiko kunin@@ omiya later -rrb- , assass@@ in@@ ate yoshinobu hi@@ tot@@ sub@@ ashi -lrb- yoshinobu t@@ ugawa -rrb- and kat@@ amori matsudaira of the aizu clan , and take emperor k@@ ou@@ myo@@ u to choshu .
furthermore , the search revealed that the loy@@ al@@ ists from the choshu , tosa , and higo clans were planning to hold a meeting at ik@@ ed@@ aya or shi@@ koku@@ ya to discus@@ s whether or not to go forward with the plan of attack after hearing about the arrest of fur@@ ut@@ aka .
the shinsen@@ -gumi had asked for support from the aizu , kuw@@ ana , and other clans , but their actions were too s@@ low , and they did not move when the time came .
that is why the bos@@ s , isami kondo , know@@ ing that every moment counted , acted alone by spl@@ it@@ ting their members into two squ@@ ads under kondo and hijikata and began the search .
at the time , the shinsen@@ -gumi was shor@@ t-@@ handed because many members were sick , so only 34 members took part in the search - 10 in the kondo squad and 24 in the hijikata squad -lrb- there are different views on the number . c@@ f . list of soldiers involved -rrb- .
the hijikata squad , a part of the shinsen@@ -gumi , sear@@ ched n@@ aw@@ ate street from yas@@ aka shrine , while the kondo squad sear@@ ched ki@@ yam@@ achi street across the sanjo bridge .
at the end of the search , the kondo squad found rad@@ ical nation@@ al@@ ists who were having a meeting at ik@@ ed@@ aya .
a few members of the kondo squad attacked them and got into a battle in the middle of the night .
four of the members - isami kondo , so@@ ji ok@@ ita , shinp@@ achi nag@@ akura , and hei@@ suke todo - first attacked the 20@@ -@@ some rad@@ ical nation@@ al@@ ists while the rest shor@@ ed up the per@@ im@@ eter .
some ron@@ ins fran@@ tic@@ ally attacked hay@@ at@@ ar@@ ou ando , ei@@ suke oku@@ zawa and kaku@@ zaemon nitta who guarded the back door , and succeeded to escape .
oku@@ zawa died in the attack , and ando and nitta died a month later .
ok@@ ita went inside the building and fought hard , but collapsed during the battle and withdrew from it .
some accoun@@ ts say that this was because of a tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is@@ -@@ related blood sp@@ it@@ ting , but there is a lot of doub@@ t and it is not certain .
then , a sword hit the fore@@ head of todo on the first floor when swe@@ at caused his hel@@ met to s@@ li@@ p out of place , and he withdrew from the battle .
although there were kondo and nag@@ akura only at one point , the arrival of the hijikata squad til@@ ted the od@@ ds in favor of the shinsen@@ -gumi and achieved a result of nine people killed and four arrested .
aizu and kuw@@ ana clans arrived there to support them after the battle .
hijikata would not let them any@@ where near , to ens@@ ure that they could not take cred@@ it .
although some of the rad@@ ical nation@@ al@@ ists escaped from the battle , the next morning more than 20 people were arrested by carrying out cl@@ earing operations with aizu , kuw@@ ana , and other clans .
the swe@@ ep of the city turned viol@@ ent , and there were 5 immediate deaths among the aizu clan , four among the hikone clan , and two among the kuw@@ ana clan .
at no@@ on of the following day , the shinsen@@ -gumi returned to their base in mibu village . -lrb- if they had returned to their base at night , they might have fallen into an am@@ bus@@ h , so they took a rest in the city until dawn . -rrb-
it is said that the ro@@ ad@@ side was crow@@ ded with on@@ look@@ ers .
the name of the shinsen@@ -gumi , which succeeded in prev@@ enting the plot to bur@@ n down the imperial palace , became famous throughout the land .
the `` rev@@ ere the emperor , ex@@ pe@@ l foreigners `` faction , on the other hand , took a big b@@ low with the deaths of such important activ@@ ists as toshi@@ maro yoshida , k@@ ic@@ hima kit@@ az@@ oe , tei@@ zo miy@@ abe , mat@@ a@@ jiro o@@ taka , jun@@ jiro ishikawa , matsu@@ suke sug@@ iyama and ju@@ suke matsu@@ da . -lrb- they were later called the `` seven mar@@ ty@@ r@@ s `` by the new government . -rrb-
kog@@ oro katsura -lrb- later takayoshi kido -rrb- should have been there too , but he arrived earlier and then went back to the base to wait a while . his life had been spar@@ ed because the incident occurred before he came back .
beginning with this incident , the choshu clan fell under the influence of ze@@ al@@ ots and later came to kyoto and raised the kin@@ mon rebellion on july 19 -lrb- in the old calendar -rrb- .
it has been said that the ik@@ ed@@ aya incident del@@ ayed the meiji restoration by a year . there is also another opinion that it sp@@ ed up the restoration by st@@ ir@@ ring up the `` rev@@ ere the emperor , ex@@ pe@@ l foreigners `` faction .
author ryo@@ taro shiba ` s interpretation is that the meiji restoration led by the four major clans of satsuma , choshu , tosa , and bizen would never have happened without this incident .

murasaki shikibu -lrb- dates of birth and death unknown -rrb- was a female author and poet in the mid-heian period .
she is well known as the author of `` the tale of genji . ``
she is one of the ch@@ uko san@@ ju@@ rok@@ kas@@ en -lrb- medieval 36 immortal poets -rrb- .
her poem , ` i met a friend after so long , who went back in a hur@@ ry before i recognized his face ; like the moon goes behind a clou@@ d at a b@@ low ` was selected for `` ogura hyakunin isshu -lrb- one hundred poems by one hundred poets -rrb- . ``
she was from the fujiwara clan , and her name as a court lady was ` fuji shikibu -lrb- murasaki shikibu -rrb- . `
she acquired the so@@ bri@@ qu@@ et of ` murasaki ` from the name of the her@@ o@@ ine ` murasaki no ue ` of `` the tale of genji , `` and ` shikibu ` refers to her father ` s position as shiki@@ bu@@ tai@@ jo -lrb- ai@@ de of ceremon@@ ials -rrb- .
murasaki shikibu ` s real name is unknown , but it is assumed that she was the ` fujiwara no ka@@ or@@ iko / tak@@ ako / koshi , ` who became shoji -lrb- ranked -rrb- on january 29 , 100@@ 7 , which was described in ` mid@@ o kanp@@ ak@@ uki -lrb- fujiwara no michinaga ` s diary -rrb- . `
however this view is generally based on the other assum@@ p@@ tions , which are said to contain er@@ rors in the process of making infer@@ ences , so it remains a matter of con@@ j@@ ecture .
also , her dates of birth and death are unknown , but it is suggested that she was about 30 years old in 100@@ 8 , based on historical materials and her works ; by coun@@ ting back@@ wards from that age , she would have been born around 9@@ 79 and died around 10@@ 16 .
tradition has it that she liked s@@ ard@@ ines , which was unusual for aristocracy , but this episode is based on a story of izumi shikibu in ` sar@@ ug@@ en@@ ji no soshi -lrb- the sar@@ ug@@ en@@ ji book -rrb- , ` so it seems to have been made up by someone at a later date .
she was a daughter of fujiwara no tamet@@ oki , governor of echigo province , and her mother was a daughter of fujiwara no tam@@ enobu from settsu province , but she lost her mother when she was little .
fujiwara no nob@@ unori was her brother by a different father , and apparently she also had an older sister .
fujiwara no sad@@ akata , sanjo udaijin -lrb- sanjo minister of the right -rrb- , and fujiwara no kane@@ suke , tsu@@ t@@ sumi chunagon -lrb- vice-councilor of state -rrb- , were her paternal great grand@@ fa@@ thers , and she had many relatives who were known as talented writers .
there are many anecdotes stating that , since her childhood , she had had more talent for reading chinese classics than women were required to have in those days .
it is generally considered that she wrote both `` the tale of genji , `` which consists of 54 chapters , and `` murasaki shikibu diary , `` which was about her days in service to the imperial court , as well as `` collection of murasaki shikibu ` s works . ``
her father , fujiwara no tamet@@ oki , obtained employ@@ ment as a read@@ er in togu -lrb- the palace of the crown prince -rrb- while in his thir@@ ties , and when the crown prince became emperor kazan he was promoted to the post of kurodo -lrb- chamberlain -rrb- and then to shiki@@ bu@@ tai@@ jo ; however , when the emperor became a priest , he lost his job .
ten years later , as a con@@ sequ@@ ence of dedic@@ ating a poem to emperor ichijo , he became a governor of echizen province .
murasaki shikibu , during her childhood , spent two years in the place of her father ` s ass@@ ign@@ ment .
in about 99@@ 8 , she married a governor of yamashiro province fujiwara no nobutaka , who was old enough to be her father ; in 99@@ 9 she bore him a daughter , fujiwara no kat@@ ai@@ ko / ken@@ shi , but this marriage life didn ` t last long because nobutaka died soon afterward .
in december 29 -lrb- according to the lunar calendar -rrb- of 100@@ 5 , she began serving the empress of emperor ichijo fujiwara no shoshi / akiko -lrb- the oldest daughter of fujiwara no michinaga , and later given the name of the retired emperor jo@@ tom@@ onin -rrb- as a court lad@@ y-@@ c@@ um@@ -@@ tut@@ or , and she served the empress at least until 10@@ 11 .
there is a poem created by ise no taifu , ` some time ago , double-@@ flow@@ ered cherry trees blo@@ om@@ ed in the col@@ or@@ ful capital of nara ; today they bloom in ku@@ ju castle in this capital of kyo , as they did before , ` which was collected in `` shi@@ ka wakashu -lrb- collection of poetry -rrb- `` ; the poem was written in dedic@@ ation to the empress along with ya@@ ez@@ akura -lrb- double cherry blossoms -rrb- presented to the imperial court ; however , according to `` ise no taifu shu -lrb- private collection -rrb- `` it was supposed to be a duty of murasaki shikibu , but she deleg@@ ated the duty to a new@@ com@@ er , taifu .
the last description about murasaki shikibu appears in `` sho@@ yuki , `` the diary of fujiwara no sane@@ suke , dated may 25 -lrb- lunar calendar -rrb- 10@@ 14 , saying that ` as `` a daughter of tamet@@ oki , who was a governor of echigo province , `` she conve@@ yed a message from the wife of the retired empress shoshi to sane@@ suke . `
therefore it is widely believed that she died between 10@@ 12 and 10@@ 16 , in the reign of emperor sanjo , but some people dis@@ ag@@ ree .
also , tradition has it that murasaki shikibu ` s grave can be found at murasaki no nishi@@ go@@ shod@@ en@@ -cho -lrb- horikawa kita@@ oji kud@@ aru , west side -rrb- , kita ward , kyoto city .
today , the bank of japan ` s d-@@ note of 2,000 yen has a portrait of murasaki shikibu and a part of `` the tale of genji emaki -lrb- picture scroll -rrb- `` on its back side .
her name appeared in the great historical figures calendar of the united nations educational , scient@@ ific and cultural organization -lrb- = un@@ es@@ co -rrb- , and she was the only japanese to be thus en@@ rolled .
you can read some comm@@ ents about her contemporary famous court ladies .
above all , a com@@ ment about sei shonagon , the author of the pil@@ low book , is the most famous -lrb- the following is a free translation -rrb- :
sei shonagon is a j@@ er@@ k who acts pro@@ ud@@ ly . chinese characters , she blo@@ ts in a wise , have full of mist@@ akes . ` -lrb- `` murasaki diary `` kuro@@ kawab@@ on -lrb- type of manuscript -rrb- -rrb-
`` will the life of a person with such ins@@ inc@@ er@@ ity be better in the future ? `` -lrb- from `` murasaki diary `` kuro@@ kawab@@ on -rrb-
these comm@@ ents are quite severe and can be said to be almost back@@ b@@ iting .
these descriptions have been brought into conver@@ s@@ ation with various con@@ j@@ ect@@ ures and cur@@ i@@ os@@ ity -lrb- murasaki shikibu was je@@ al@@ ous of the talent of sei shonagon , etc . -rrb- up until recently .
however , these two people were dist@@ ant in age and served the imperial court in different times -lrb- nearly a dec@@ ade -rrb- , so they seem not to have known each other .
she wrote some posit@@ ive comm@@ ents about her contemporary female poets , izumi shikibu -lrb- ` her behavior is not good , but her poems are excellent , ` etc . -rrb- , and akaz@@ om@@ e-@@ emon .
emperor ichijo had a court lady read al@@ ou@@ d `` the tale of genji , `` at which he praised the author , saying she must have been an e@@ ager read@@ er of nihongi -lrb- according to `` sh@@ oku-@@ nihongi -lrb- continu@@ ation of chronicles of japan -rrb- , `` whereby nihongi refers to `` nihonshoki -lrb- chronicles of japan -rrb- `` ; thus some people claim that `` nihongi `` in this cont@@ ext means `` nihonshoki `` -rrb- .
because of this , murasaki shikibu was given the nickname ` nihongi no ot@@ sub@@ one , ` but it is widely thought that the emperor ` s words brought her into rid@@ ic@@ u@@ le because it was felt that a woman shou@@ ldn ` t read chinese classics , and she was dist@@ ressed by the words .
murasaki diary and `` eiga monogatari -lrb- a tale of flow@@ ering fortun@@ es -rrb- , `` the latter of which has some descriptions common to the murasaki diary , states that michinaga visited her chamber at night .
additionally , `` various japanese family trees `` -lrb- `` new compilation of various japanese family trees an@@ alog@@ y `` -rrb- says that ` a court lady of jo@@ tom@@ onin , a poet , murasaki shikibu , an author of the tale of genji , or masat@@ ada ` s grand@@ daughter , tamet@@ oki ` s daughter , mist@@ ress of michinaga , the chief adviser to the emperor , ` which clearly shows that she was a mist@@ ress of michinaga , but the true relationship between them is unknown .

takauji ashikaga -lrb- 130@@ 5-@@ 58 -rrb- was a general from the late kamakura period to the northern and southern courts period .
he was the 1st seii taishogun of the muromachi shogunate .
takauji was a descendant of the genji clan .
he was the 1st son of sad@@ auji ashikaga , who was a descendant in the direct line of the ashikaga clan , which was the powerful family in kawachi genji .
in his early years , he was given the name takauji by the regent takat@@ oki hojo .
in 1333 , when the emperor go-@@ daigo had raised an army at mt . sen@@ jos@@ an in hoki province , takauji , the powerful vassal of the kamakura shogunate , was sent to kyoto leading the main armies of the shogunate to put down the rebellion , but he swit@@ ched sides and gathered an army against the shogunate at shin@@ omura hachimangu in tam@@ ba province to capture rokuhara tandai .
his achievements were evaluated by emperor go-@@ daigo , and he was awarded the letter -lrb- 尊 -rrb- , which came from the emperor ` s real name taka@@ haru -lrb- 尊@@ 治 -rrb- , so he changed the letter in his name from `` 高@@ 氏 `` to `` 尊@@ 氏 `` .
while the des@@ pot@@ ic kenmu restoration by emperor go-@@ daigo had been losing support , takauji traveled to the east to suppress the nakas@@ en@@ dai rebellion , and stayed in kamakura to try to build his own government .
because of this , the relationship between takauji and the imperial court came to an im@@ pass@@ e , and he returned to kyoto , dr@@ iving the emperor go-@@ daigo out to mt . hiei . however , the emperor ` s army made a counter@@ attack and takauji fled to kyushu temporarily .
he re@@ entered kyoto and established a new samurai government called the muromachi shogunate , being appointed seii taishogun by grand emperor -lrb- retired emperor -rrb- kog@@ on and emperor komyo .
at the same time , emperor go-@@ daigo moved to yoshino and set up the southern court there .
after he established the muromachi shogunate , he and his brother tadayoshi ashikaga divided power between them , but in later years disc@@ ord between them increased until the kan@@ no disturbance .
the disturbance sub@@ sided with the death of tadayoshi , but even after that takauji had to keep fighting against his enemies , such as the southern court forces , to maintain his government .
after emperor go-@@ daigo died , takauji built ten@@ ryu-ji temple to pray for the dead .
because of his rebellion against the emperor , people had bran@@ ded him as a tr@@ a@@ itor since the meiji era , but after world war ii they began to look at him more posit@@ ively , which illustr@@ ates how much the historical point of view aff@@ ects the way we look at the people in history .
from birth to the fall of the kamakura shogunate
takauji was born in 130@@ 5 .
there are 3 pre@@ sum@@ p@@ tions about his birthplace : ayabe -lrb- ue@@ sug@@ i@@ sho in ayabe city , kyoto -rrb- , kamakura and ashi@@ kag@@ ano sho -lrb- ashikaga city , tochigi prefecture -rrb- .
`` nan@@ -@@ taiheiki `` says that when takauji was given his first bath , two tur@@ t@@ l@@ ed@@ o@@ ves fle@@ w in ; one per@@ ched on his shoulder , and the other on the di@@ pper .
his childhood name was mat@@ at@@ aro .
on october 10th , 13@@ 19 , his coming-of-age ceremony -lrb- genpuku -rrb- was held at age 15 , and he was appointed ji@@ bu@@ taifu of the fifth rank , junior grade , and given the name takauji by the regent takat@@ oki hojo .
takauji ` s father sad@@ auji and his official wife shak@@ ado , daughter of akit@@ oki hojo , had the first son takayoshi ashikaga , but he died early and takauji succeeded to his father .
according to `` nan@@ -@@ taiheiki `` , iet@@ oki ashikaga , takauji ` s grandfather , killed himself with his sword , praying that the ashikaga clan may rule over the whole country in 3 generations .
in 13@@ 31 , emperor go-@@ daigo plot@@ ted the overthrow of the shogunate again and raised an army at kas@@ agi -lrb- genko incident -rrb- .
the kamakura shogunate ordered takauji , who had been a powerful vassal , to help the shogunate , and he joined the battles at kas@@ agi where the emperor was based and at shimo@@ ak@@ asaka castle in which masashige kusunoki was based .
the incident had taken place just after his father ` s death , so takauji at first had refused his help to the shogunate , but the kamakura shogunate took his wife and children as ho@@ stages to make takauji follow its order .
according to `` ko@@ ten-@@ taiheiki , `` because of this takauji began to har@@ b@@ or ho@@ st@@ ility toward the shogunate .
as a result of the attack against the emperor made by the shogunate , the emperor and his followers such as toshi@@ moto hino and en@@ kan were captured , and the following year emperor go-@@ daigo was exiled to oki islands -lrb- genko rebellion -rrb- .
the shogunate installed emperor kog@@ on of the jimyo@@ -in line as emperor , instead of emperor go-@@ daigo of the daik@@ aku-ji line .
in the following year , emperor go-@@ daigo escaped from oki islands , and raised an army at mt . sen@@ jos@@ an .
takauji was ordered to re@@ enter kyoto with tak@@ aie nag@@ oe to put down the rebellion in the west .
tak@@ aie was killed by nor@@ imura akamatsu , which made takauji decide to side with the emperor . on april 2@@ 9th of the same year , he raised an army against the shogunate at shin@@ omura hachimangu -lrb- present kameoka city , kyoto -rrb- in tam@@ ba province .
takauji gathered forces from various provinces , and entered kyoto followed by vassals such as do@@ yo sasaki from omi province , and then succeeded in destro@@ ying rokuhara tandai on may 7th , 1333 .
at about the same time , yoshisada nitta , vassal of kozuke province , also gathered an army , and destroyed the shogunate , taking takauji ` s heir sen@@ ju@@ o -lrb- later called yoshiakira ashikaga -rrb- , who had escaped from kamakura , with him .
in this fighting , take@@ wakam@@ aru , the son of takauji ` s concubine , was killed .
after the kamakura shogunate was cr@@ umb@@ led , takauji ordered kazu@@ uji hosokawa , yori@@ haru hosokawa and mor@@ ou@@ ji hosokawa to make yoshisada nitta return to kyoto , and let the ashikaga clan rule kamakura .
after the fall of the kamakura shogunate , emperor go-@@ daigo considered takauji ` s work to be comm@@ end@@ able , and gave him the ranks of chin@@ ju@@ fu shogun and sa@@ hyoe no kami with the cour@@ tly title of fourth rank , junior grade , along with 30 pl@@ ots of land .
in addition to that , he was given the letter -lrb- 尊 -rrb- , which came from the emperor ` s given name , and changed the letter of his name takauji -lrb- 高@@ 氏 -rrb- into takauji -lrb- 尊@@ 氏 -rrb- .
under the kenmu administration , takauji left politics and let ko no moronao , the regent of the ashikaga clan , and ko no moro@@ yasu eng@@ age in politics , while he made his brother tadayoshi the regent of the kamakura shogun@@ fu .
there are two interpre@@ t@@ ations of takauji ` s behavior ; one is that it was emperor go-@@ daigo who made takauji leave politics , and the other is that it was takauji who tried to keep away from the government .
there is also a different pre@@ sum@@ ption that takauji intended to establish the new government in kamakura .
this condition was called `` takauji ` s ab@@ sence in the new government `` .
while emperor go-@@ daigo appointed aki@@ ie kitabatake as chin@@ ju@@ fu shogun and made him take prince nor@@ iyoshi -lrb- later called emperor go-@@ murakami -rrb- to oshu in order to pac@@ ify the place , takauji made tadayoshi lead young prince nar@@ inaga -lrb- nar@@ iyoshi -rrb- down to kamakura .
emperor go-@@ daigo ` s son prince mor@@ inaga , who also co@@ v@@ et@@ ed the title of seii taishogun , gradually came to riv@@ al takauji , and plot@@ ted to assass@@ in@@ ate him , but takauji ` s security was so t@@ ight that he failed to do it .
in 13@@ 34 , takauji captured and confined prince mor@@ inaga , who was in conflict with the emperor too , to tadayoshi ` s place in kamakura , conspir@@ ing with the emperor ` s mist@@ ress ya@@ suko -lrb- kad@@ oko -rrb- ano , who wanted to make her son prince tsun@@ enaga -lrb- tsune@@ yoshi -rrb- a crown prince .
in 13@@ 35 , nakas@@ en@@ dai rebellion was raised in shinano province by the surv@@ iv@@ ors of the hojo clan , taking tok@@ iyuki hojo , ber@@ ea@@ ved son of takat@@ oki hojo , with them , and tok@@ iyuki ` s army occupied kamakura temporarily .
in the rebellion , tadayoshi killed prince mor@@ inaga without permission .
takauji requested that emperor go-@@ daigo appoin@@ t him seii taishogun only to be rejected , so he mar@@ ched to kamakura without emperor ` s permission on august 2nd of the same year , which made emperor go-@@ daigo rel@@ uc@@ tan@@ tly appoin@@ t him as sei@@ to taishogun .
tadayoshi ` s army , joined by takauji , defeated tok@@ iyuki hojo at the battle of sag@@ am@@ igawa and reg@@ ained kamakura on the 19th of the same month .
takauji was given the cour@@ tly title of the second rank .
with tadayoshi ` s approval , takauji established a base in kamakura and began to al@@ lot lands to his followers , ignor@@ ing the emperor ` s command to return to kyoto , and he tried to establish his own samurai government .
in november , takauji suggested to the emperor that yoshisada nitta was an enemy of the imperial court and should be killed , but on the contrary the emperor ordered yoshisada to kill takauji , making yoshisada take prince takan@@ aga -lrb- takayoshi -rrb- to kamakura along tokaido .
besides that , aki@@ ie kitabatake began to go down to kyoto from oshu , so takauji declared his retirement to get a re@@ pri@@ eve . however , once the ashikaga side , including tadayoshi and ko no moronao , began to lose at various provinces such as mikawa , takauji decided to revolt against the kenmu government .
in december of the same year , takauji defeated nitta ` s army at the battle of hak@@ one take no shi@@ ta , and advanced his army up to kyoto .
during that time , takauji secretly made contact with emperor kog@@ on of the jimyo@@ -in line to just@@ ify his entering kyoto .
in the following month , takauji reached kyoto , while emperor go-@@ daigo fled to mt . hiei .
shor@@ tly thereafter , takauji was attacked in kyoto by the armies of aki@@ ie kitabatake , masashige kusunoki and yoshisada nitta from oshu , and he gave up kyoto , accep@@ ting en@@ shin akamatsu ` s advice to leave for kyushu .
on his way down to kyushu , yoshin@@ ao -lrb- yori@@ hisa -rrb- shon@@ i came to meet him at ak@@ amag@@ as@@ eki , nagato province -lrb- present shimon@@ oseki city , yamaguchi prefecture -rrb- , and he was supported by ujin@@ ori mun@@ akata , the chief priest of mun@@ akata taisha shrine in mun@@ akata , chikuzen province .
in the beginning of march , after visiting mun@@ akata taisha , takauji defeated taket@@ oshi kikuchi -lrb- emperor go-@@ daigo ` s side -rrb- at the battle of tat@@ ara@@ hama -lrb- present fukuoka city -rrb- , and on his way up to kyoto , he got emperor kog@@ on ` s order and immediately gathered western warriors .
he s@@ ma@@ shed the armies of yoshisada nitta and masashige kusunoki at the battle of min@@ at@@ ogawa on april 2@@ 5th of the same year , and seized kyoto again in june .
takauji attempted a reconc@@ ili@@ ation with emperor go-@@ daigo , who had been at mt . hiei , to save face for the emperor .
emperor go-@@ daigo , accep@@ ting takauji ` s offer , transferred the imperial reg@@ al@@ ia of japan to emperor komyo , a younger brother of grand emperor kog@@ on , and right after that , on november 7th , takauji declared the opening of a new samurai government , setting the kenmu shi@@ kim@@ oku in order to show the basic policy of his government to his people .
emperor go-@@ daigo escaped from kyoto to yoshino -lrb- present yoshin@@ o-cho , yoshin@@ o-@@ gun , nara prefecture -rrb- taking the imperial reg@@ al@@ ia of japan with him in december , and announced that the transferred reg@@ al@@ ia were f@@ ake , so he established yoshino imperial court -lrb- = southern court -rrb- .
in 13@@ 38 , takauji was appointed seii taishogun -lrb- re@@ igned 13@@ 3@@ 8-@@ 58 -rrb- by emperor komyo , which meant that an actual samurai government later called muromachi shogunate was established .
in the following year , when emperor go-@@ daigo passed away in yoshino , takauji began to found ten@@ ryu-ji temple to pray for the soul of the dead emperor .
in order to raise the funds to build the temple , a trading v@@ es@@ sel called ten@@ ryu@@ -@@ ji-@@ bune was set sai@@ l for yuan dynasty .
under the new government , takauji gave tadayoshi a post as administrative leader and he himself became the leader of the house vassals .
shin ` ichi sato called such conditions di@@ archy by takauji , who held a military power in the l@@ ord@@ -@@ and-@@ vassal relationship , and tadayoshi , who controlled the judicial functions of the regime , in his ess@@ ay ` muromachi bakufu ` in `` i@@ aw@@ an@@ ami ko@@ za nihon re@@ kishi vol@@ . 7 `` -lrb- i@@ aw@@ an@@ ami publishing , 1963 -rrb- and explained that the pot@@ enti@@ ality of the shogun ` s d@@ ual power which had continued since kamakura shogunate , came to appear .
the d@@ ual power gradually led to a conflict between anti-@@ tadayoshi group represented by ko no moronao , and the tadayoshi group in the government .
this conflict finally raised an internal split called the kan@@ no disturbance .
at first takauji took a ne@@ u@@ tr@@ al stance on it , but he came to side with moronao ` s group .
in 13@@ 49 , moronao demanded tadayoshi ` s retirement from politics , surrounding takauji ` s castle in which tadayoshi had shel@@ tered .
tadayoshi became a priest and lost his power , but it is said that moronao and takauji made an arrangement to exclud@@ e tadayoshi .
while takauji called back his heir yoshiakira from kamakura to put him in charge of political affairs instead of tadayoshi , he sent his second son mo@@ tou@@ ji ashikaga to kamakura in return and set the kam@@ ak@@ ur@@ afu to rule the eastern provinces , appoin@@ ting mo@@ tou@@ ji kamakura kubo .
after tadayoshi ` s retreat , takauji ` s illegitimate son - also tadayoshi ` s adopted son - tada@@ fuyu ashikaga was en@@ lar@@ ging his power as a member of the tadayoshi faction in kyushu , so takauji made an expedition to chugoku district to kill tada@@ fuyu in 13@@ 50 .
then tadayoshi escaped from kyoto and sided with the southern court , followed by a few of the devoted military commanders such as tadatsune mom@@ on@@ oi and kun@@ ik@@ iyo hatakeyama .
when tadayoshi ` s army grew str@@ on@@ ger , yoshiakira became pow@@ er@@ less and fled from kyoto . takauji was also defeated by tadayoshi ` s army at uchi@@ de@@ hama in settsu province -lrb- present nishin@@ omiya city , hyogo prefecture -rrb- .
takauji sought reconc@@ ili@@ ation with tadayoshi on condition that the ko brothers would become priests , and they came to an agreement in 13@@ 51 .
the ko brothers were assassinated by yoshinori uesugi while they were under es@@ cor@@ t .
tadayoshi became yoshiakira ` s assistant and got involved in political affairs again .
takauji and yoshiakira mar@@ ched to harima province on the o@@ st@@ en@@ sible purpose to put down the revolt plot@@ ted by do@@ yo sasaki and soku@@ yu -lrb- nori@@ suke -rrb- akamatsu , but in reality they attempted a reconc@@ ili@@ ation with the southern court , conspir@@ ing to kill tadayoshi and tada@@ fuyu .
sen@@ sing this conspiracy , tadayoshi fled to the northern area and reached kamakura .
in october of the same year , takauji and the southern court reconc@@ iled , an event that was called sho@@ hei@@ -@@ it@@ to .
at the same time , takauji ch@@ ased tadayoshi along the tokaido , and defeated him at the battles of mt . sat@@ su@@ tam@@ ayama in suruga province -lrb- present-day shimizu ward , shimizu city , shizuoka prefecture -rrb- and ha@@ yak@@ awa@@ jiri in sagami province -lrb- present-day odawara city , kanagawa prefecture -rrb- . takauji captured tadayoshi and confined him in kamakura .
tadayoshi died suddenly in february , 13@@ 52 .
`` taiheiki `` says that tadayoshi might have been po@@ is@@ oned by takauji .
soon after tadayoshi ` s death , being attacked by the southern court forces represented by prince mune@@ yoshi , yoshioki nitta , yoshimune nitta and tok@@ iyuki hojo , takauji retreated to musashi province , but soon returned to kyoto to defeat the southern forces .
after that tada@@ fuyu ashikaga in@@ tr@@ uded in kyoto , but eventually he left for kyushu .
in 13@@ 54 , kyoto was re@@ taken by the southern court temporarily , but taken back by takauji the following year .
he plot@@ ted to kill tada@@ fuyu , but died of a t@@ um@@ or on his back at the palace of made ` n@@ okoji in nijo , kyoto , on april 30@@ th , 13@@ 58 .
his age at death : 54 .
according to `` bai@@ shor@@ on , `` takauji reg@@ ret@@ ted having turned against emperor go-@@ daigo , and he for a while he was tal@@ king about becoming a priest . in the heat of battle he also tal@@ ked about killing himself , so shin ` ichi sato took these descriptions into consideration , and presumed that takauji might have been a man@@ ic de@@ pres@@ sive .
takauji ` s close friend soseki mus@@ o described takauji as a man of virtue in his writing .
takauji was w@@ illing to al@@ lot lands to his military commanders , which is considered one of the reasons why he was always supported by them when he was in difficult situations .
it was the mit@@ og@@ aku originated by mitsuk@@ uni tokugawa that started to consider takauji as a tr@@ a@@ itor in the edo period .
mit@@ og@@ aku was strongly influenced by shus@@ hig@@ aku mei@@ bun@@ ron , and emphasized the val@@ id@@ ity of the imperial line .
because of this , takauji , who exiled the authent@@ ic emperor -lrb- go-@@ daigo -rrb- , was described in a neg@@ ative way as a tr@@ a@@ itor .
mit@@ og@@ aku ` s view of takauji was inherited by the later generations , and in the late tokugawa period when son@@ no-@@ joi -lrb- rev@@ ere the emperor , ex@@ pe@@ l the barbar@@ ian -rrb- cul@@ min@@ ated , the heads of wooden statues of takauji , yoshiakira and yoshimitsu -lrb- ashikaga -rrb- in to@@ ji@@ -in were pill@@ or@@ ied .
after the meiji period , the meiji government sought to establish a nation@@ -@@ state which set the emperor in the center of the nation . this produced a nation@@ al@@ istic view of history , which just@@ ified taisei hokan and os@@ ei fuk@@ ko , and so the taika reforms , kenmu no ch@@ uko -lrb- = kenmu restoration -rrb- and meiji restoration were ranked as the most important reforms .
until mid meiji period , sour@@ c@@ e-@@ based study of modern history did not emphas@@ ize the val@@ id@@ ity of emperor go-@@ daigo -lrb- the southern court -rrb- , but at around 1907 40 when the nan@@ boku@@ cho sei@@ jun@@ ron arose , the val@@ id@@ ity of emperor go-@@ daigo came to be st@@ ressed , creating a neg@@ ative evalu@@ ation of takauji .
according to an author@@ ized text@@ book written before w@@ wi@@ i , takauji was `` a tr@@ a@@ itor who released an arrow against the emperor `` , and kum@@ ak@@ ichi naka@@ jima , a member of the mak@@ oto saito cabinet , was forced to ret@@ ire because he had praised takauji in his writing .
after w@@ wi@@ i , the nation@@ al@@ istic view of history became ob@@ sol@@ et@@ e , and the sour@@ c@@ e-@@ based study of history made progress on re@@ evalu@@ ating takauji .
sato ` s interpretation of takauji as a ruler in the l@@ ord@@ -@@ and-@@ vassal relationship was one example , which af@@ for@@ ded an opportunity to develop a study of the samurai government .
in today ` s historical study , no@@ body interpre@@ ts takauji as a tr@@ a@@ itor any more , and the process of takauji ` s becoming a tr@@ a@@ itor sometimes can be a theme of historical study .
`` shi@@ hon taiheiki `` written by ei@@ ji yoshi@@ kawa in the late 195@@ 0s had takauji as a main character , and was accepted by many read@@ ers , which suggested that not only the political but also the cultural view of takauji had shifted very much compared with that before w@@ wi@@ i .
`` ki@@ bam@@ u@@ sha zo `` -lrb- a portrait of warrior on the horse back -rrb- , preserved in the kyoto national museum , was generally known as a portrait of takauji , but is now considered to be a portrait of ko no moronao , the regent of the ashikaga clan , or that of ko no moro@@ akira , son of moronao . it ` s because there ` s a decorative sig@@ nature of the 2nd shogun yoshiakira on the upper part of the body , and the family crest of the two rings described on the warrior ` s har@@ ness was not the ashikaga family ` s , but the ko family ` s .
portrait of taira no shigemori , one of the jin@@ go-ji san zo , painted by fujiwara no takan@@ obu in kamakura period , had been considered a portrait of shigemori taira , but michi@@ o yon@@ ek@@ ura and hide@@ o kuroda claimed that it is a portrait of takauji , and now this interpretation is widely accepted .
their opinion is based on the compar@@ ison of the portrait with the wooden statue of takauji preserved in to@@ ji@@ -in , and the popular shape of the hat@@ p@@ in , called kog@@ ai , used in the early muromachi period .
there ` s another portrait of takauji preserved in jod@@ o-ji temple in onom@@ ichi city , hiroshima prefecture .
in addition to that , there are some ukiyoe pictures of takauji : `` taiheiki k@@ ass@@ en@@ zu , `` by yoshi@@ tora utagawa ; and `` ashikaga takauji hyogo k@@ ass@@ en@@ zu , `` by chi@@ kan@@ obu hashimoto . both paintings deal with takauji shel@@ ter@@ ing in the jod@@ o-ji temple in hyogo prefecture .
also some bronze statues of takauji were made recently ; one is placed on the approach to the bun@@ n@@ a-ji temple in ashikaga city , and the other is in an@@ koku@@ ji town , ayabe city , kyoto prefecture .

the se@@ im@@ ei@@ -jinja shrine is a shinto shrine in kamigyo ward of kyoto city .
it ` s dedicated to seimei abe .
it ` s located at the site of his premises , which once existed near -lrb- north@@ west of -rrb- the ichijo mod@@ ori-@@ bashi .
there are many shrines nationwide with the same name .
when seimei died in 100@@ 5 , ichi@@ j@@ yo , the emperor of the time , adm@@ ired his work and called him the re@@ inc@@ ar@@ nation of inari the god . a shrine was built and dedicated to him at the site of his premises in 100@@ 7 .
the area of the shrine was large at first but gradually d@@ imin@@ ished through events like wars and the urban improvement by hideyoshi toyotomi and its buildings were left dec@@ ayed .
from the last days of the t@@ ugawa shogunate , the shrine ` s buildings and precincts were re@@ paired by funds raised mainly by the shrine par@@ ishi@@ on@@ ers . in 1950 , the shrine ` s area was changed to face horikawa street .
during the he@@ isei era , seimei abe became extremely popular and worshi@@ pers have come to visit the shrine from all over the country .

the 22 shrines are part of the shak@@ aku for shinto shrines .
they were established from the middle to late heian period .
these shrines receive special offerings from the imperial court .
they are mostly chosen from shrines in the kinai area .
establishment of the 22 shrines
under the ritsuryo system , offerings were given by the imperial court for kin@@ en-@@ sai and other festivals to many shrines listed in the eng@@ i-@@ shiki jim@@ myo@@ -cho ; but that number has been reduced to a special few shrines after the decline of the ritsuryo system .
that number and the shrines in it changed many times and came to include some newly established shrines , before being fin@@ alized as the following 22 shrines in 10@@ 81 .
although the movement at the end of the heian period to include itsuk@@ us@@ hima shrine was not successful , that shrine received offerings from the imperial court until the latter part of the muromachi period , and even in the edo period in the event of disast@@ ers .
